<title>Versioning</title>

<para>Please, please update the version number in 
<filename>source/include/version.h</filename> to include the versioning of your package. This makes it easier to distinguish standard samba builds
from custom-build samba builds (distributions often patch packages). For 
example, a good version would be: </para>

<para><programlisting>
Version 2.999+3.0.alpha21-5 for Debian
</programlisting></para>

<title>Modules</title>

<para>Samba now has support for building parts of samba as plugins. This 
makes it possible to, for example, put ldap or mysql support in a seperate 
package, thus making it possible to have a normal samba package not 
depending on ldap or mysql. To build as much parts of samba 
as a plugin, run: </para>

<para><programlisting>
./configure --with-shared-modules=rpc,vfs,auth,pdb,charset
</programlisting></para>

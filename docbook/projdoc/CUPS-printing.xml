		The Common UNIX Print System (<ulink url="http://www.cups.org/">CUPS</ulink>)
		has become quite popular. All major Linux distributions now ship it as their default printing
		system. To many, it is still a mystical tool. Mostly, it just works.
		People tend to regard it as a <quote>black box</quote>
		that they do not want to look into as long as it works. But once
		there is a little problem, they are in trouble to find out where to
		start debugging it. Refer to the chapter <quote>Classical Printing</quote> that
		contains a lot of information that is relevant for CUPS.

		Das Common UNIX Print System (<ulink url="http://www.cups.org/">CUPS</ulink>)
		ist mittlerweile sehr populär geworden. Alle großen
		Linux Distributionen liefern dieses als das Standard
		Druck System aus. Für viele ist es ein mystisches Tool.
		Hauptsache es funktioniert einfach. Daher wird es 
		oft als <quote>Black Box</quote> angesehen und solange
		es funktioniert möchte sich auch niemand damit
		befassen. Sobald aber ein kleines Problem auftritt
		bekomme sie Schwierigkeiten herauszufinden wie man mit
		der Fehlersuche beginnt. Sehr viele Informationen welche

		CUPS sports quite a few unique and powerful features. While their
		basic functions may be grasped quite easily, they are also
		new. Because they are different from other, more traditional printing
		systems, it is best not to try and apply any prior knowledge about
		printing to this new system. Rather, try to understand CUPS
		from the beginning. This documentation will lead you to a
		complete understanding of CUPS. Let's start with the most basic
		things first.

		CUPS bietet einige mächtige und einmalige Möglichkeiten.
		Neu ist auch die sehr einfache Handhabung der
		grundsätzlichen Funktionen. Da diese Funktionen anders
		sind als in den mehr traditionell orientierten
		Drucksystemen, wenden Sie am besten nicht ihr
		bisheriges Wissen bzgl. Drucken an.
		Versuchen Sie lieber eher CUPS von Grund auf zu
		vestehen. Diese Dokumentation möchte Sie zu einem
		kompletten Verständniss von CUPS führen. 
		Zuerst möchten wir mit den grundsätzlichen Dingen beginnen.

		CUPS is more than just a print spooling system. It is a complete
		printer management system that complies with the new
		Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). IPP is an industry
		and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
		standard for network printing. Many of its functions can be managed
		remotely (or locally) via a Web browser (giving you a
		platform-independent access to the CUPS print server). Additionally, it
		has the traditional command line and several more modern GUI interfaces
		(GUI interfaces developed by third parties, like KDE's
		overwhelming <ulink url="http://printing.kde.org/">KDEPrint</ulink>).

		CUPS ist mehr als nur ein Print Spooling System. Es ist
		ein komplettes Drucker Management System welches das
		neue Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) erfüllt. IPP ist
		ein Industrie und Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Standard für 
		das Drucken in Netzwerken. Viele seiner Funktionen kann
		remote oder lokal über einen Webbrowser gemanaget
		werden. Dies bietet Ihnen einen Plattform unabhängigen
		Zugriff zum CUPS Printserver. Zusätzlich hat es die
		traditionellen Kommandozeilen Tools und weitere moderne
		GUI Schnittstellen. (GUI Schnittstellen von
		Drittherstellern, wie etwa das überwältigende in KDE
		enthaltene <ulink url="http://printing.kde.org/">KDEPrint</ulink>).
		</para>
		<para>
		CUPS allows creation of <quote>raw</quote> printers (i.e., no print file
		format translation) as well as <quote>smart</quote> printers (i.e., CUPS does
		file format conversion as required for the printer). In many ways
		this gives CUPS similar capabilities to the MS Windows print
		monitoring system. Of course, if you are a CUPS advocate, you would
		argue that CUPS is better! In any case, let us now move on to
		explore how one may configure CUPS for interfacing with MS Windows
		print clients via Samba.
		</para>

		<para>
		CUPS erlaubt die Erstellung von <quote>raw</quote>
		Druckern (keine Übersetzung der Druckdaten) genauso wie
		von <quote>smart</quote> Druckern (Cups übersetzt das
		Dateiformat in das benötigte Druckerformat). Diese
		Fexibilität gibt CUPS ähnliche Möglichkeiten wie das MS
		Windows Print Monitoring System. Sind Sie ein CUPS
		Verfechter, dann werden Sie sicher argumentieren das es
		sogar besser ist ! Wie auch immer, lassen Sie uns
		damit weitermachen wie wir CUPS für eine Zusammenarbeit
		mit MS Windows Druckclients über SAMBA konfigurieren
		müssen.

	<title>Basic CUPS Support Configuration</title>
	#
	<title>Grundlegende Konfiguration für den CUPS Support</title>

	<para>
	Printing with CUPS in the most basic &smb.conf; setup in Samba-3.0 (as was true for 2.2.x) only needs two
	settings: <smbconfoption><name>printing</name><value>cups</value></smbconfoption> and
	<smbconfoption><name>printcap</name><value>cups</value></smbconfoption>. CUPS does not need a printcap file.
	However, the <filename>cupsd.conf</filename> configuration file knows of two related directives that control
	how such a file will be automatically created and maintained by CUPS for the convenience of third-party
	applications (example: <parameter>Printcap /etc/printcap</parameter> and <parameter>PrintcapFormat BSD</parameter>).
	Legacy programs often require the existence of a printcap file containing printer names or they will refuse to
	print. Make sure CUPS is set to generate and maintain a printcap file. For details, see
	<command>man cupsd.conf</command> and other CUPS-related documentation, like the wealth of documents on your CUPS server
	itself: <ulink noescape="1" url="http://localhost:631/documentation.html">http://localhost:631/documentation.html</ulink>.
	</para>
	#
	<para>
	In Samba-3.0 (gilt auch für 2.2.x) sind für das grundlegende
	Drucken mit CUPS nur 2 Einträge nötig:
	<smbconfoption><name>printing</name><value>cups</value></smbconfoption>
	and
	<smbconfoption><name>printcap</name><value>cups</value></smbconfoption>.
	CUPS benötig auch keine printcap Datei.
	Dennoch gibt es in der Konfigurationsdatei
	<filename>cupsd.conf</filename> zwei dazu relevante Einträge die
	dazu dienen diese Datei anzulegen und zu verwalten damit
	Anwendungen von Drittherstellern damit umgehen können (Beispiel:
	<parameter>Printcap /etc/printcap</parameter> and
	<parameter>PrintcapFormat BSD</parameter>).
	Ältere Programme benötigen oft zum drucken diese printcap Datei mit den
	Namen der Drucker. Stellen Sie daher sicher das CUPS so
	konfiguriert wurde das diese printcap Datei erstellt und
	gewartet wird. Für Details schauen Sie in die man Page
	<command>man cupsd.conf</command>, in die CUPS relevanten
	Dokumentationen sowie in die vielen Infos vom CUPS Server
	selbst: <ulink noescape="1" url="http://localhost:631/documentation.html">http://localhost:631/documentation.html</ulink>.

		<title>Linking smbd with libcups.so</title>

		<para>
		Samba has a special relationship to CUPS. Samba can be compiled with CUPS library support.
		Most recent installations have this support enabled. Per default, CUPS linking is compiled
		into smbd and other Samba binaries. Of course, you can use CUPS even
		if Samba is not linked against <filename>libcups.so</filename> &smbmdash; but
		there are some differences in required or supported configuration.
		</para>

		<para>
		When Samba is compiled against <filename>libcups</filename>, <smbconfoption><name>printcap</name><value>cups</value></smbconfoption>
		uses the CUPS API to list printers, submit jobs, query queues, and so on. Otherwise it maps to the System V
		commands with an additional <command>-oraw</command> option for printing. On a Linux
		system, you can use the <command>ldd</command> utility to find out details (ldd may not be present on
		other OS platforms, or its function may be embodied by a different command):
		</para>

<para><screen>
&rootprompt;<userinput>ldd `which smbd`</userinput>
libssl.so.0.9.6 =&gt; /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.6 (0x4002d000)
libcrypto.so.0.9.6 =&gt; /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.6 (0x4005a000)
libcups.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib/libcups.so.2 (0x40123000)
[....]
</screen></para>

		<para>
		The line <computeroutput>libcups.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib/libcups.so.2 (0x40123000)</computeroutput> shows
		there is CUPS support compiled into this version of Samba. If this is the case, and printing = cups
		is set, then <emphasis>any otherwise manually set print command in &smb.conf; is ignored</emphasis>.
		This is an important point to remember!
		</para>

		<tip><para> Should it be necessary, for any reason, to set your own print commands, you can do this by setting
		<smbconfoption><name>printing</name><value>sysv</value></smbconfoption>. However, you will loose all the benefits
		of tight CUPS/Samba integration. When you do this you must manually configure the printing system commands
		(most important: 
		<smbconfoption><name>print command</name></smbconfoption>; other commands are
		<smbconfoption><name>lppause command</name></smbconfoption>,
		<smbconfoption><name>lpresume command</name></smbconfoption>,
		<smbconfoption><name>lpq command</name></smbconfoption>,
		<smbconfoption><name>lprm command</name></smbconfoption>,

		<para>
		This is all you need for basic printing setup for CUPS. It will print
		all graphic, text, PDF, and PostScript files submitted from Windows
		clients. However, most of your Windows users would not know how to
		send these kinds of files to print without opening a GUI
		application. Windows clients tend to have local printer drivers
		installed, and the GUI application's print buttons start a printer
		driver. Your users also rarely send files from the command
		line. Unlike UNIX clients, they hardly submit graphic, text or PDF
		formatted files directly to the spooler. They nearly exclusively print
		from GUI applications with a <quote>printer driver</quote> hooked in between the
		application's native format and the print-data-stream. If the backend
		printer is not a PostScript device, the print data stream is <quote>binary,</quote>
		sensible only for the target printer. Read on to learn which problem
		this may cause and how to avoid it.

	<para>
	This special share is only there for testing purposes. It does not write the print job to a file. It just logs the job parameters
	known to Samba into the <filename>/tmp/smbprn.log</filename> file and deletes the job-file. Moreover, the
	<smbconfoption><name>printer admin</name></smbconfoption> of this share is <quote>kurt</quote> (not the <quote>@ntadmins</quote> group),
	guest access is not allowed, the share isn't published to the Network Neighborhood (so you need to know it is there), and it only
	allows access from only three hosts. To prevent CUPS kicking in and taking over the print jobs for that share, we need to set
	<smbconfoption><name>printing</name><value>sysv</value></smbconfoption> and
	<smbconfoption><name>printcap</name><value>lpstat</value></smbconfoption>.

	<title>Advanced Configuration</title>

	<para>
	Before we delve into all the configuration options, let us clarify a few
	points. <emphasis>Network printing needs to be organized and setup
	correctly</emphasis>. This frequently doesn't happen. Legacy systems
	or small business LAN environments often lack design and good housekeeping.

	<title>Central Spooling vs. <quote>Peer-to-Peer</quote> Printing</title>


	<para>
<indexterm><primary>spooling</primary><secondary>central</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>spooling</primary><secondary>peer-to-peer</secondary></indexterm>
	Many small office or home networks, as well as badly organized larger
	environments, allow each client a direct access to available network
	printers. This is generally a bad idea. It often blocks one client's
	access to the printer when another client's job is printing. It might
	freeze the first client's application while it is waiting to get
	rid of the job. Also, there are frequent complaints about various jobs
	being printed with their pages mixed with each other. A better concept
	is the usage of a print server: it routes all jobs through one
	central system, which responds immediately, takes jobs from multiple
	concurrent clients at the same time, and in turn transfers them to the
	printer(s) in the correct order.

	<title>Raw Print Serving &smbmdash; Vendor Drivers on Windows Clients</title>


	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>spooling-only</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>"raw" printing</primary></indexterm>
	Most traditionally configured UNIX print servers acting on behalf of
	Samba's Windows clients represented a really simple setup. Their only
	task was to manage the <quote>raw</quote> spooling of all jobs handed to them by
	Samba. This approach meant that the Windows clients were expected to
	prepare the print job file that its ready to be sent to the printing
	device. Here a native (vendor-supplied) Windows printer driver needs to
	be installed on each and every client for the target device.
	</para>

	<para>
	It is possible to configure CUPS, Samba and your Windows clients in the
	same traditional and simple way. When CUPS printers are configured
	for RAW print-through mode operation, it is the responsibility of the
	Samba client to fully render the print job (file). The file must be
	sent in a format that is suitable for direct delivery to the
	printer. Clients need to run the vendor-provided drivers to do
	this. In this case, CUPS will not do any print file format conversion
	work.
	</para>

	<para>
	The easiest printing configuration possible is to use raw print-through.
	This is achieved by installation of the printer as if it was physically
	attached to the Windows client. You then redirect output to a raw network
	print queue. The following procedure may be followed to achieve this:
	</para>

	<procedure>
		<step><para>
		Edit <filename>/etc/cups/mime.types</filename> to uncomment the line
		near the end of the file that has:
<screen>
#application/octet-...
</screen>
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		Do the same for the file <filename>/etc/cups/mime.convs</filename>.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		Add a raw printer using the Web interface. Point your browser at
		<constant>http://localhost:631</constant>. Enter Administration, add
		the printer following the prompts. Do not install any drivers for it.
		Choose Raw. Choose queue name <constant>Raw Queue</constant>.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		In the &smb.conf; file <constant>[printers]</constant> section add
		<smbconfoption><name>use client driver</name><value>Yes</value></smbconfoption>,
		and in the <constant>[global]</constant> section add
		<smbconfoption><name>printing</name><value>CUPS</value></smbconfoption>, plus
		<smbconfoption><name>printcap</name><value>CUPS</value></smbconfoption>.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		Install the printer as if it is a local printer. i.e.: Printing to <constant>LPT1:</constant>.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		Edit the configuration under the <guimenu>Detail</guimenu> tab, create a
		<constant>local port</constant> that points to the raw printer queue that
		you have configured above. Example: <constant>\\server\raw_q</constant>.
		Here, the name <constant>raw_q</constant> is the name you gave the print
		queue in the CUPS environment.
		</para></step>

	<title>Installation of Windows Client Drivers</title>

	<para>
	The printer drivers on the Windows clients may be installed
	in two functionally different ways:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Manually install the drivers locally on each client,
	one by one; this yields the old <emphasis>LanMan</emphasis> style

	<listitem><para>
	<indexterm><primary>point 'n' print</primary></indexterm>
			Deposit and prepare the drivers (for later download) on
			the print server (Samba); this enables the clients to use
	<quote>Point'n'Print</quote> to get drivers semi-automatically installed the
	first time they access the printer; with this method NT/200x/XP
	clients use the <emphasis>SPOOLSS/MS-RPC</emphasis>
	type printing calls.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
	The second method is recommended for use over the first.

	<indexterm><primary>MIME</primary><secondary>raw</secondary></indexterm>
	If you use the first option (drivers are installed on the client

		<listitem><para><filename>/etc/cups/mime.convs</filename></para></listitem>

	<para>
	Both contain entries (at the end of the respective files) which must
	be uncommented to allow RAW mode operation.
	In <filename>/etc/cups/mime.types</filename>, make sure this line is

	<filterline>
		application/octet-stream   application/vnd.cups-raw   0   - 
	</filterline>

	If these two files are not set up correctly for raw Windows client
	printing, you may encounter the dreaded <computeroutput>Unable to
	convert file 0</computeroutput> in your CUPS error_log file. 
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>application/octet-stream</primary></indexterm>
	CUPS being a more security-aware printing system than traditional ones
	does not by default allow a user to send deliberate (possibly binary)
	data to printing devices. This could be easily abused to launch a
	<quote>Denial of Service</quote> attack on your printer(s), causing at least
	the loss of a lot of paper and ink. <quote>Unknown</quote> data are tagged by CUPS
	as <parameter>MIME type: application/octet-stream</parameter> and not
	allowed to go to the printer. By default, you can only send other
	(known) MIME types <quote>raw</quote>. Sending data <quote>raw</quote> means that CUPS does not
	try to convert them and passes them to the printer untouched (see the next
	chapter for even more background explanations).
	</para>
	</formalpara>

	<para>
	This is all you need to know to get the CUPS/Samba combo printing
	<quote>raw</quote> files prepared by Windows clients, which have vendor drivers

	In Windows OS, the format conversion job is done by the printer

	In UNIX and Linux, there is no comparable layer built into the OS
	kernel(s) or the X (screen display) server. Every application is
	responsible for itself to create its print output. Fortunately, most
	use PostScript and that at least gives some common ground. Unfortunately,
	there are many different levels of quality for this PostScript. And
	worse, there is a huge difference (and no common root) in the way
	the same document is displayed on screen and how it is presented on
	paper. WYSIWYG is more difficult to achieve. This goes back to the
	time, decades ago, when the predecessors of X.org,
	designing the UNIX foundations and protocols for Graphical User
	Interfaces, refused to take responsibility for <quote>paper output</quote>
	also, as some had demanded at the time, and restricted itself to
	<quote>on-screen only.</quote> (For some years now, the <quote>Xprint</quote> project has been
	under development, attempting to build printing support into the X
	framework, including a PostScript and a PCL driver, but it is not yet
	ready for prime time.) You can see this unfavorable inheritance up to

	<indexterm><primary>PostScript</primary></indexterm>
	The PostScript programming language is an <quote>invention</quote> by Adobe Inc.,
	but its specifications have been published to the full. Its strength
	lies in its powerful abilities to describe graphical objects (fonts,
	shapes, patterns, lines, curves, and dots), their attributes (color,
	linewidth) and the way to manipulate (scale, distort, rotate,
	shift) them. Because of its open specification, anybody with the
	skill can start writing his own implementation of a PostScript
	interpreter and use it to display PostScript files on screen or on
	paper. Most graphical output devices are based on the concept of
	<quote>raster images</quote> or <quote>pixels</quote> (one notable exception is pen
	plotters). Of course, you can look at a PostScript file in its textual
	form and you will be reading its PostScript code, the language
	instructions which need to be interpreted by a rasterizer. Rasterizers
	produce pixel images, which may be displayed on screen by a viewer
	program or on paper by a printer.

	So, UNIX is lacking a common ground for printing on paper and
	displaying on screen. Despite this unfavorable legacy for UNIX, basic
	printing is fairly easy if you have PostScript printers at your
	disposal. The reason is these devices have a built-in PostScript
	language <quote>interpreter,</quote> also called a Raster Image
	Processor (RIP) (which makes them more expensive than
	other types of printers); throw PostScript toward them, and they will
	spit out your printed pages. Their RIP is doing all the hard work of
	converting the PostScript drawing commands into a bitmap picture as
	you see it on paper, in a resolution as done by your printer. This is
	no different to PostScript printing a file from a Windows origin.

	Traditional UNIX programs and printing systems &smbmdash; while

	However, there are other types of printers out there. These do not know

	the traditional (and quite powerful) PostScript interpreter used on

	<emphasis>lot</emphasis> of file format conversions for a very broad
	spectrum of hardware devices as well as software file formats.

	<tip><para>
	Use the <quote>gs -h</quote> command to check for all built-in <quote>devices</quote>
	of your Ghostscript version. If you specify a parameter of
	<parameter>-sDEVICE=png256</parameter> on your Ghostscript command
	line, you are asking Ghostscript to convert the input into a PNG
	file. Naming a <quote>device</quote> on the command line is the most important
	single parameter to tell Ghostscript exactly how it should render the
	input. New Ghostscript versions are released at fairly regular
	intervals, now by artofcode LLC. They are initially put under the
	<quote>AFPL</quote> license, but re-released under the GNU GPL as soon as the next

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>PPD</primary></indexterm>
	While PostScript in essence is a Page Description
	Language (PDL) to represent the page layout in a
	device-independent way, real-world print jobs are
	always ending up being output on hardware with device-specific
	features. To take care of all the differences in hardware and to
	allow for innovations, Adobe has specified a syntax and file format
	for PostScript Printer Description (PPD)
	files. Every PostScript printer ships with one of these files.
	</para>

	<para>
	PPDs contain all the information about general and special features of the
	given printer model: Which different resolutions can it handle? Does
	it have a Duplexing Unit? How many paper trays are there? What media
	types and sizes does it take? For each item, it also names the special
	command string to be sent to the printer (mostly inside the PostScript
	file) in order to enable it.
	</para>

	<para>
	Information from these PPDs is meant to be taken into account by the
	printer drivers. Therefore, installed as part of the Windows
	PostScript driver for a given printer is the printer's PPD. Where it
	makes sense, the PPD features are presented in the drivers' UI dialogs
	to display to the user a choice of print options. In the end, the
	user selections are somehow written (in the form of special
	PostScript, PJL, JCL or vendor-dependent commands) into the PostScript
	file created by the driver.

	<title>CUPS Also Uses PPDs for Non-PostScript Printers</title>

	<para>
	CUPS also uses specially crafted PPDs to handle non-PostScript
	printers. These PPDs are usually not available from the vendors (and
	no, you can't just take the PPD of a PostScript printer with the same
	model name and hope it works for the non-PostScript version too). To
	understand how these PPDs work for non-PS printers, we first need to
	dive deeply into the CUPS filtering and file format conversion
	architecture. Stay tuned.
	</para>
	</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>The CUPS Filtering Architecture</title>

<para>
The core of the CUPS filtering system is based on
Ghostscript. In addition to Ghostscript, CUPS
uses some other filters of its own. You (or your OS vendor) may have
plugged in even more filters. CUPS handles all data file formats under
the label of various MIME types. Every incoming
printfile is subjected to an initial
auto-typing. The auto-typing determines its given
MIME type. A given MIME type implies zero or more possible filtering
chains relevant to the selected target printer. This section discusses
how MIME types recognition and conversion rules interact. They are
used by CUPS to automatically setup a working filtering chain for any
given input data format.
</para>

<para>
If CUPS rasterizes a PostScript file natively to
a bitmap, this is done in two stages:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>The first stage uses a Ghostscript device named <quote>cups</quote>
(this is since version 1.1.15) and produces a generic raster format
called <quote>CUPS raster</quote>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The second stage uses a <quote>raster driver</quote> that converts
		the generic CUPS raster to a device-specific raster.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Make sure your Ghostscript version has the <quote>cups</quote> device compiled in
(check with <command>gs -h | grep cups</command>). Otherwise you
may encounter the dreaded <computeroutput>Unable to convert file
0</computeroutput> in your CUPS error_log file. To have <quote>cups</quote> as a
device in your Ghostscript, you either need to patch GNU
Ghostscript and re-compile, or use <indexterm><primary>ESP</primary><secondary>Ghostscript</secondary></indexterm><ulink
url="http://www.cups.org/ghostscript.php">ESP Ghostscript</ulink>. The
superior alternative is ESP Ghostscript. It supports not just CUPS,
but 300 other devices too (while GNU Ghostscript supports only about
180). Because of this broad output device support, ESP Ghostscript is
the first choice for non-CUPS spoolers, too. It is now recommended by
Linuxprinting.org for all spoolers.
</para>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>cupsomatic</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>foomatic</primary></indexterm>
CUPS printers may be setup to use external rendering paths. One of the most common is provided by the
Foomatic/cupsomatic concept from <ulink url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/">Linuxprinting.org.</ulink> This
uses the classical Ghostscript approach, doing everything in one step. 
It does not use the <quote>cups</quote> device, but one of the many
others. However, even for Foomatic/cupsomatic usage, best results and
<indexterm><primary>ESP</primary><secondary>Ghostscript</secondary></indexterm>
broadest printer model support is provided by ESP Ghostscript (more
about cupsomatic/Foomatic, particularly the new version called now
<emphasis>foomatic-rip</emphasis>, follows below).

<sect2>
<title>MIME Types and CUPS Filters</title>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>MIME</primary><secondary>filters</secondary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>MIME</primary></indexterm>
CUPS reads the file <filename>/etc/cups/mime.types</filename>
(and all other files carrying a <filename>*.types</filename> suffix
in the same directory) upon startup. These files contain the MIME
type recognition rules that are applied when CUPS runs its
auto-typing routines. The rule syntax is explained in the man page
for <filename>mime.types</filename> and in the comments section of the
<filename>mime.types</filename> file itself. A simple rule reads
like this:

<indexterm><primary>application/pdf</primary></indexterm>
<filterline>
 application/pdf         pdf string(0,%PDF)
</filterline>

This means if a filename has either a
<filename>.pdf</filename> suffix or if the magic
string <emphasis>%PDF</emphasis> is right at the
beginning of the file itself (offset 0 from the start), then it is
a PDF file (<parameter>application/pdf</parameter>).
Another rule is this: 

<filterline>
 application/postscript  ai eps ps string(0,%!) string(0,&lt;04&gt;%!)
</filterline>

If the filename has one of the suffixes
<filename>.ai</filename>, <filename>.eps</filename>,
<filename>.ps</filename> or if the file itself starts with one of the
strings <emphasis>%!</emphasis> or <emphasis><![CDATA[<04>%!]]></emphasis>, it
is a generic PostScript file
(<parameter>application/postscript</parameter>).
</para>

<warning><para>
Don't confuse the other mime.types files your system might be using
with the one in the <filename>/etc/cups/</filename> directory.
</para></warning>

<note><para>
There is an important difference between two similar MIME types in
CUPS: one is <parameter>application/postscript</parameter>, the other is
<parameter>application/vnd.cups-postscript</parameter>. While
<parameter>application/postscript</parameter> is meant to be device
independent (job options for the file are still outside the PS file
content, embedded in command line or environment variables by CUPS),
<parameter>application/vnd.cups-postscript</parameter> may have the job
options inserted into the PostScript data itself (where
applicable). The transformation of the generic PostScript
(<parameter>application/postscript</parameter>) to the device-specific version
(<parameter>application/vnd.cups-postscript</parameter>) is the responsibility of the
CUPS <parameter>pstops</parameter> filter. pstops uses information
contained in the PPD to do the transformation.
</para></note>

<para>
CUPS can handle ASCII text, HP-GL, PDF, PostScript, DVI, and
many image formats (GIF. PNG, TIFF, JPEG, Photo-CD, SUN-Raster,
PNM, PBM, SGI-RGB, and more) and their associated MIME types
with its filters.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>MIME Type Conversion Rules</title>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>MIME</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>application/pdf</primary></indexterm>
CUPS reads the file <filename>/etc/cups/mime.convs</filename>
(and all other files named with a <filename>*.convs</filename>
suffix in the same directory) upon startup. These files contain
lines naming an input MIME type, an output MIME type, a format
conversion filter that can produce the output from the input type
and virtual costs associated with this conversion. One example line
reads like this:

<filterline>
 application/pdf         application/postscript   33   pdftops
</filterline>

This means that the <parameter>pdftops</parameter> filter will take
<parameter>application/pdf</parameter> as input and produce
<parameter>application/postscript</parameter> as output; the virtual
cost of this operation is 33 CUPS-$. The next filter is more
expensive, costing 66 CUPS-$:

<indexterm><primary>pdf</primary></indexterm>

<filterline>
 application/vnd.hp-HPGL application/postscript   66   hpgltops
</filterline>

This is the <parameter>hpgltops</parameter>, which processes HP-GL
plotter files to PostScript.

<indexterm><primary>application/octet-stream</primary></indexterm>

<filterline>
 application/octet-stream
</filterline>

Here are two more examples: 

<indexterm><primary>text/plain</primary></indexterm>

<filterline>
 application/x-shell     application/postscript   33    texttops
 text/plain              application/postscript   33    texttops
</filterline>

The last two examples name the <parameter>texttops</parameter> filter
to work on <parameter>text/plain</parameter> as well as on <parameter>application/x-shell</parameter>. (Hint:
This differentiation is needed for the syntax highlighting feature of
<parameter>texttops</parameter>).

<title>Filtering  Overview</title>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>MIME</primary></indexterm>
There are many more combinations named in <filename>mime.convs</filename>. However, you
are not limited to use the ones pre-defined there. You can plug in any
filter you like into the CUPS framework. It must meet, or must be made
to meet, some minimal requirements. If you find (or write) a cool
conversion filter of some kind, make sure it complies to what CUPS
needs and put in the right lines in <filename>mime.types</filename>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>PostScript</primary></indexterm>
As previously stated, PostScript is the central file format to any UNIX-based
printing system. From PostScript, CUPS generates raster data to feed
non-PostScript printers.
</para>

<para>
But what happens if you send one of the supported non-PS formats
to print? Then CUPS runs <quote>pre-filters</quote> on these input formats to
generate PostScript first. There are pre-filters to create PS from
ASCII text, PDF, DVI, or HP-GL. The outcome of these filters is always
of MIME type <parameter>application/postscript</parameter> (meaning that
any device-specific print options are not yet embedded into the
PostScript by CUPS, and that the next filter to be called is
pstops). Another pre-filter is running on all supported image formats,
the <parameter>imagetops</parameter> filter. Its outcome is always of
MIME type <parameter>application/vnd.cups-postscript</parameter>
(not application/postscript), meaning it has the
print options already embedded into the file.

(commands to the printer to ask for the duplexing of output, or
stapling and punching it, and so on) into the PostScript file.

<title>pstoraster</title>

<para>
<parameter>pstoraster</parameter> is at the core of the CUPS filtering
system. It is responsible for the first stage of the rasterization
process. Its input is of MIME type application/vnd.cups-postscript;
its output is application/vnd.cups-raster. This output format is not
yet meant to be printable. Its aim is to serve as a general purpose
input format for more specialized <emphasis>raster drivers</emphasis>
that are able to generate device-specific printer data.
</para>

<para>
	<image scale="25"><imagedescription>PostScript to intermediate raster format.</imagedescription><imagefile>6small</imagefile></image>
</para>

<para>
CUPS raster is a generic raster format with powerful features. It is
able to include per-page information, color profiles, and more, to be
used by the following downstream raster drivers. Its MIME type is
registered with IANA and its specification is, of course, completely
open. It is designed to make it quite easy and inexpensive for
manufacturers to develop Linux and UNIX raster drivers for their
printer models, should they choose to do so. CUPS always takes care
for the first stage of rasterization so these vendors do not need to care
about Ghostscript complications (in fact, there is currently more
than one vendor financing the development of CUPS raster drivers).

<para>
CUPS versions before version 1.1.15 were shipping a binary (or source
code) standalone filter, named <parameter>pstoraster</parameter>. <parameter>pstoraster</parameter> was derived
from GNU Ghostscript 5.50, and could be installed besides and in
addition to any GNU or AFPL Ghostscript package without conflicting.
</para>

<para>
>From version 1.1.15, this has changed. The functions for this have been
integrated back into Ghostscript (now based on GNU Ghostscript version
7.05). The <parameter>pstoraster</parameter> filter is now a simple shell script calling
<command>gs</command> with the <command>-sDEVICE=cups</command>
parameter. If your Ghostscript does not show a success on asking for
<command>gs -h |grep cups</command>, you might not be able to
print. Update your Ghostscript.

In the section about pre-filters, we mentioned the pre-filter
that generates PostScript from image formats. The <parameter>imagetoraster</parameter>
filter is used to convert directly from image to raster, without the
intermediate PostScript stage. It is used more often than the above
mentioned pre-filters. We summarize flowchart of image file

CUPS ships with quite different raster drivers processing CUPS

<parameter>rastertoescp</parameter>, <parameter>rastertohp</parameter>, and
<parameter>rastertoprinter</parameter>. Don't worry if you have less
than this; some of these are installed by commercial add-ons to CUPS
(like <parameter>rastertoturboprint</parameter>), others (like
<parameter>rastertoprinter</parameter>) by third-party driver
development projects (such as Gimp-Print) wanting to cooperate as
closely as possible with CUPS.

<title>CUPS Backends</title>

<para>
The last part of any CUPS filtering chain is a backend. Backends
are special programs that send the print-ready file to the final
device. There is a separate backend program for any transfer
protocol of sending print jobs over the network, or for every local
interface. Every CUPS print queue needs to have a CUPS <quote>device-URI</quote>
associated with it. The device URI is the way to encode the backend
used to send the job to its destination. Network device-URIs are using
two slashes in their syntax, local device URIs only one, as you can
see from the following list. Keep in mind that local interface names
may vary much from my examples, if your OS is not Linux:

	</para></listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>http </term>
	<listitem><para>

	</simplelist>
	</para>

	<para>
	The smb:// backend is a symlink to the Samba utility
	<parameter>smbspool</parameter> (does not ship with CUPS). If the
	symlink is not present in your CUPS backend directory, have your
	root user create it: <command>ln -s `which smbspool'
	/usr/lib/cups/backend/smb</command>.
	</para></listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
It is easy to write your own backends as shell or Perl scripts, if you
need any modification or extension to the CUPS print system. One
reason could be that you want to create <quote>special</quote> printers that send
the print-jobs as email (through a <quote>mailto:/</quote> backend), convert them to
PDF (through a <quote>pdfgen:/</quote> backend) or dump them to <quote>/dev/null</quote>. (In
fact I have the system-wide default printer set up to be connected to
a devnull:/ backend: there are just too many people sending jobs
without specifying a printer, or scripts and programs which do not name
a printer. The system-wide default deletes the job and sends a polite
email back to the $USER asking him to always specify the correct
printer name.)
</para>

<para>
Not all of the mentioned backends may be present on your system or
usable (depending on your hardware configuration). One test for all
available CUPS backends is provided by the <emphasis>lpinfo</emphasis>
utility. Used with the <option>-v</option> parameter, it lists
all available backends:

<title>The Role of <parameter>cupsomatic/foomatic</parameter></title>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>cupsomatic</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>foomatic</primary></indexterm>
<parameter>cupsomatic</parameter> filters may be the most widely used on CUPS
installations. You must be clear about the fact that these were not
developed by the CUPS people. They are a third party add-on to
CUPS. They utilize the traditional Ghostscript devices to render jobs
for CUPS. When troubleshooting, you should know about the
difference. Here the whole rendering process is done in one stage,
inside Ghostscript, using an appropriate device for the target
printer. <parameter>cupsomatic</parameter> uses PPDs that are generated from the Foomatic
Printer &amp; Driver Database at Linuxprinting.org.
</para>

<para>
You can recognize these PPDs from the line calling the
<parameter>cupsomatic</parameter> filter:

<filterline>
 *cupsFilter: "application/vnd.cups-postscript  0  cupsomatic"
</filterline>

You may find this line among the first 40 or so lines of the PPD
file. If you have such a PPD installed, the printer shows up in the
CUPS Web interface with a <parameter>foomatic</parameter> namepart for
the driver description. <parameter>cupsomatic</parameter> is a Perl script that runs
Ghostscript with all the complicated command line options
auto-constructed from the selected PPD and command line options give to
the print-job.
</para>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>point 'n' print</primary></indexterm>
	However, <parameter>cupsomatic</parameter> is now deprecated. Its PPDs (especially the first
generation of them, still in heavy use out there) are not meeting the
Adobe specifications. You might also suffer difficulties when you try
to download them with <quote>Point'n'Print</quote> to Windows clients. A better
and more powerful successor is now in a stable beta-version: it is called <parameter>foomatic-rip</parameter>. To use
<parameter>foomatic-rip</parameter> as a filter with CUPS, you need the new-type PPDs. These
have a similar but different line:

<filterline>
 *cupsFilter: "application/vnd.cups-postscript  0  foomatic-rip"
</filterline>

The PPD generating engine at Linuxprinting.org has been revamped.
The new PPDs comply to the Adobe spec. On top, they also provide a
new way to specify different quality levels (hi-res photo, normal
color, grayscale, and draft) with a single click, whereas before you
could have required five or more different selections (media type,
resolution, inktype and dithering algorithm). There is support for
custom-size media built in. There is support to switch
print-options from page to page in the middle of a job. And the
best thing is the new foomatic-rip now works seamlessly with all
legacy spoolers too (like LPRng, BSD-LPD, PDQ, PPR and so on), providing
for them access to use PPDs for their printing.

<title>The Complete Picture</title>

<para>
If you want to see an overview of all the filters and how they
relate to each other, the complete picture of the puzzle is at the end
of this document.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title><filename>mime.convs</filename></title>

<para>
CUPS auto-constructs all possible filtering chain paths for any given
MIME type, and every printer installed. But how does it decide in
favor or against a specific alternative?  (There may often be cases
where there is a choice of two or more possible filtering chains for
the same target printer.) Simple. You may have noticed the figures in
the third column of the mime.convs file. They represent virtual costs
assigned to this filter. Every possible filtering chain will sum up to
a total <quote>filter cost.</quote> CUPS decides for the most <quote>inexpensive</quote> route.
</para>

<tip><para>
The setting of <parameter>FilterLimit 1000</parameter> in
<filename>cupsd.conf</filename> will not allow more filters to
run concurrently than will consume a total of 1000 virtual filter
cost. This is an efficient way to limit the load of any CUPS
server by setting an appropriate <quote>FilterLimit</quote> value. A FilterLimit of
200 allows roughly one job at a time, while a FilterLimit of 1000 allows
approximately five jobs maximum at a time.
</para></tip>
</sect2>

<sect2>
	<title><quote>Raw</quote> Printing</title>

<para>
	You can tell CUPS to print (nearly) any file <quote>raw</quote>. <quote>Raw</quote> means it
	will not be filtered. CUPS will send the file to the printer <quote>as is</quote>
without bothering if the printer is able to digest it. Users need to
take care themselves that they send sensible data formats only. Raw
printing can happen on any queue if the <quote><parameter>-o raw</parameter></quote> option is specified
on the command line. You can also set up raw-only queues by simply not
associating any PPD with it. This command:
</para>

<para><screen>
&prompt;<userinput>lpadmin -P rawprinter -v socket://11.12.13.14:9100 -E</userinput>
</screen></para>

<para>
	sets up a queue named <quote>rawprinter</quote>, connected via the <quote>socket</quote>
	protocol (a.k.a. <quote>HP JetDirect</quote>) to the device at IP address
11.12.1.3.14, using port 9100. (If you had added a PPD with
<command>-P /path/to/PPD</command> to this command line, you would
have installed a <quote>normal</quote> print queue.
</para>

<para>
CUPS will automatically treat each job sent to a queue as a <quote>raw</quote> one,
if it can't find a PPD associated with the queue. However, CUPS will
only send known MIME types (as defined in its own mime.types file) and
refuse others.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>application/octet-stream Printing</title>

<para>
Any MIME type with no rule in the
<filename>/etc/cups/mime.types</filename> file is regarded as unknown
or <parameter>application/octet-stream</parameter> and will not be
sent. Because CUPS refuses to print unknown MIME types per default,
you will probably have experienced the fact that print jobs originating
from Windows clients were not printed. You may have found an error
message in your CUPS logs like:
</para>

<para><computeroutput>
 Unable to convert file 0 to printable format for job
</computeroutput></para>

<para>
To enable the printing of <parameter>application/octet-stream</parameter> files, edit
these two files:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><filename>/etc/cups/mime.convs</filename></para></listitem>

<listitem><para><filename>/etc/cups/mime.types</filename></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Both contain entries (at the end of the respective files) which must
be uncommented to allow RAW mode operation for
<parameter>application/octet-stream</parameter>. In <filename>/etc/cups/mime.types</filename>
make sure this line is present:

<indexterm><primary>application/octet-stream</primary></indexterm>

<filterline>
application/octet-stream
</filterline>

This line (with no specific auto-typing rule set) makes all files
not otherwise auto-typed a member of <parameter>application/octet-stream</parameter>. In
<filename>/etc/cups/mime.convs</filename>, have this
line: 

<filterline>
application/octet-stream   application/vnd.cups-raw   0   -
</filterline>

<indexterm><primary>MIME</primary></indexterm>

This line tells CUPS to use the <emphasis>Null Filter</emphasis>
(denoted as <quote>-</quote>, doing nothing at all) on
<parameter>application/octet-stream</parameter>, and tag the result as
<parameter>application/vnd.cups-raw</parameter>. This last one is
always a green light to the CUPS scheduler to now hand the file over
to the backend connecting to the printer and sending it over.
</para>

<note><para>Editing the <filename>mime.convs</filename> and the
<filename>mime.types</filename> file does not
<emphasis>enforce</emphasis> <quote>raw</quote> printing, it only
<emphasis>allows</emphasis> it.
</para></note>

<formalpara>
<title>Background</title>

<para>
CUPS being a more security-aware printing system than traditional ones
does not by default allow one to send deliberate (possibly binary)
data to printing devices. (This could be easily abused to launch a
Denial of Service attack on your printer(s), causing at least the loss
of a lot of paper and ink...) <quote>Unknown</quote> data are regarded by CUPS
as <emphasis>MIME type</emphasis>
<emphasis>application/octet-stream</emphasis>. While you
<emphasis>can</emphasis> send data <quote>raw</quote>, the MIME type for these must
be one that is known to CUPS and an allowed one. The file
<filename>/etc/cups/mime.types</filename> defines the <quote>rules</quote> of how CUPS
recognizes MIME types. The file
<filename>/etc/cups/mime.convs</filename> decides which file
conversion filter(s) may be applied to which MIME types.

<sect2>
<title>PostScript Printer Descriptions (PPDs) for Non-PS Printers</title>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>PPD</primary></indexterm>
Originally PPDs were meant to be used for PostScript printers
only. Here, they help to send device-specific commands and settings
to the RIP which processes the job file. CUPS has extended this
scope for PPDs to cover non-PostScript printers too. This was not
difficult, because it is a standardized file format. In a way
it was logical too: CUPS handles PostScript and uses a PostScript
RIP (Ghostscript) to process the job files. The only difference is:
a PostScript printer has the RIP built-in, for other types of
printers the Ghostscript RIP runs on the host computer.
</para>

<para>
PPDs for a non-PS printer have a few lines that are unique to
CUPS. The most important one looks similar to this:

<indexterm><primary>application/vnd.cups-raster</primary></indexterm>

<filterline>
 *cupsFilter: application/vnd.cups-raster  66   rastertoprinter
</filterline>

It is the last piece in the CUPS filtering puzzle. This line tells the
CUPS daemon to use as a last filter <parameter>rastertoprinter</parameter>. This filter
should be served as input an <parameter>application/vnd.cups-raster</parameter> MIME type
file. Therefore, CUPS should auto-construct a filtering chain, which
delivers as its last output the specified MIME type. This is then
taken as input to the specified <parameter>rastertoprinter</parameter> filter. After this
the last filter has done its work (<parameter>rastertoprinter</parameter> is a Gimp-Print
filter), the file should go to the backend, which sends it to the
output device.
</para>

<para>
CUPS by default ships only a few generic PPDs, but they are good for
several hundred printer models. You may not be able to control
different paper trays, or you may get larger margins than your
specific model supports. See <link linkend="cups-ppds">PPDs shipped with CUPS</link> for summary information.

<title><emphasis>cupsomatic/foomatic-rip</emphasis> Versus <emphasis>native CUPS</emphasis> Printing</title>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>cupsomatic</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>foomatic-rip</primary></indexterm>
Native CUPS rasterization works in two steps:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
First is the <parameter>pstoraster</parameter> step. It uses the special CUPS
<indexterm><primary>ESP</primary><secondary>Ghostscript</secondary></indexterm>
device from ESP Ghostscript 7.05.x as its tool.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Second comes the <parameter>rasterdriver</parameter> step. It uses various
device-specific filters; there are several vendors who provide good
quality filters for this step. Some are free software, some are
shareware/non-free and some are proprietary.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Often this produces better quality (and has several more
advantages) than other methods.
</para>

<para>
	<image id="cupsomatic-dia"><imagedescription>cupsomatic/foomatic Processing versus Native CUPS.</imagedescription>
		<imagefile>10small</imagefile>
	</image>
</para>

<para>
One other method is the <parameter>cupsomatic/foomatic-rip</parameter>
way. Note that <parameter>cupsomatic</parameter> is <emphasis>not</emphasis> made by the CUPS
developers. It is an independent contribution to printing development,
made by people from Linuxprinting.org <footnote>see also <ulink
	noescape="1" url="http://www.cups.org/cups-help.html">http://www.cups.org/cups-help.html</ulink></footnote>.
<parameter>cupsomatic</parameter> is no longer developed and maintained and is no longer
supported. It has now been replaced by
<parameter>foomatic-rip</parameter>. <parameter>foomatic-rip</parameter> is a complete re-write
of the old <parameter>cupsomatic</parameter> idea, but very much improved and generalized to
other (non-CUPS) spoolers. An upgrade to foomatic-rip is strongly
advised, especially if you are upgrading to a recent version of CUPS,
too.
</para>

<para>
	<indexterm><primary>cupsomatic</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>foomatic</primary></indexterm>
Both the <parameter>cupsomatic</parameter> (old) and the <parameter>foomatic-rip</parameter> (new) methods from
Linuxprinting.org use the traditional Ghostscript print file
processing, doing everything in a single step. It therefore relies on
all the other devices built into Ghostscript. The quality is as
good (or bad) as Ghostscript rendering is in other spoolers. The
advantage is that this method supports many printer models not
supported (yet) by the more modern CUPS method.
</para>

<para>
Of course, you can use both methods side by side on one system (and
even for one printer, if you set up different queues) and find out
which works best for you.
</para>

<para>
<parameter>cupsomatic</parameter> kidnaps the printfile after the
<parameter>application/vnd.cups-postscript</parameter> stage and
deviates it through the CUPS-external, system-wide Ghostscript
installation. Therefore the printfile bypasses the <parameter>pstoraster</parameter> filter
(and also bypasses the CUPS-raster-drivers
<parameter>rastertosomething</parameter>). After Ghostscript finished its rasterization,
<parameter>cupsomatic</parameter> hands the rendered file directly to the CUPS backend. The

rendering and the <parameter>Foomatic/cupsomatic</parameter> method.

<title>Examples for Filtering Chains</title>

<para>
Here are a few examples of commonly occurring filtering chains to
illustrate the workings of CUPS.
</para>

<para>
Assume you want to print a PDF file to an HP JetDirect-connected
PostScript printer, but you want to print the pages 3-5, 7, 11-13
only, and you want to print them <quote>two-up</quote> and <quote>duplex</quote>:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Your print options (page selection as required, two-up,
duplex) are passed to CUPS on the command line.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The (complete) PDF file is sent to CUPS and auto-typed as
<parameter>application/pdf</parameter>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The file therefore must first pass the
<parameter>pdftops</parameter> pre-filter, which produces PostScript
MIME type <parameter>application/postscript</parameter> (a preview here
would still show all pages of the original PDF).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The file then passes the <parameter>pstops</parameter>
filter that applies the command line options: it selects the pages
2-5, 7 and 11-13, creates an imposed layout <quote>2 pages on 1 sheet</quote> and
inserts the correct <quote>duplex</quote> command (as defined in the printer's
PPD) into the new PostScript file; the file is now of PostScript MIME
type
<parameter>application/vnd.cups-postscript</parameter>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The file goes to the <parameter>socket</parameter>
backend, which transfers the job to the printers.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
	The resulting filter chain, therefore, is as drawn in <link linkend="pdftosocket">PDF to socket chain</link>.

</para>


<para>
Assume you want to print the same filter to an USB-connected
Epson Stylus Photo printer installed with the CUPS
<filename>stphoto2.ppd</filename>. The first few filtering stages
are nearly the same:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Your print options (page selection as required, two-up,
duplex) are passed to CUPS on the command-line.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The (complete) PDF file is sent to CUPS and auto-typed as
<parameter>application/pdf</parameter>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The file must first pass the
<parameter>pdftops</parameter> pre-filter, which produces PostScript
MIME type <parameter>application/postscript</parameter> (a preview here
would still show all pages of the original PDF).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The file then passes the <quote>pstops</quote> filter that applies
the command-line options: it selects the pages 2-5, 7 and 11-13,
creates an imposed layout <quote>two pages on one sheet</quote> and inserts the
correct <quote>duplex</quote> command... (Oops &smbmdash; this printer and PPD
do not support duplex printing at all &smbmdash; so this option will
be ignored) into the new PostScript file; the file is now of PostScript
MIME type 
<parameter>application/vnd.cups-postscript</parameter>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The file then passes the
		<!--FIXME-->
<parameter>pstoraster</parameter> stage and becomes MIME type
<parameter>application/
cups-raster</parameter>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Finally, the <parameter>rastertoepson</parameter> filter
does its work (as indicated in the printer's PPD), creating the
printer-specific raster data and embedding any user-selected
print-options into the print data stream.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The file goes to the <parameter>usb</parameter> backend,
which transfers the job to the printers.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

The resulting filter chain therefore is as drawn in <link linkend="pdftoepsonusb">this figure</link>.

<title>Printing with Interface Scripts</title>

<para>
CUPS also supports the usage of <quote>interface scripts</quote> as known from
System V AT&amp;T printing systems. These are often used for PCL
printers, from applications that generate PCL print jobs. Interface
scripts are specific to printer models. They have a similar role as
PPDs for PostScript printers. Interface scripts may inject the Escape
sequences as required into the print data stream, if the user has
chosen to select a certain paper tray, or print landscape, or use A3
paper, etc. Interfaces scripts are practically unknown in the Linux
realm. On HP-UX platforms they are more often used. You can use any
working interface script on CUPS too. Just install the printer with
the <command>-i</command> option:
</para>

<para><screen>
&rootprompt;<userinput>lpadmin -p pclprinter -v socket://11.12.13.14:9100 \
  -i /path/to/interface-script</userinput>
</screen></para>

<para>
Interface scripts might be the <quote>unknown animal</quote> to many. However,
with CUPS they provide the easiest way to plug in your own
custom-written filtering script or program into one specific print
queue (some information about the traditional usage of interface scripts is
to be found at <ulink

	<title>Network Printing (Purely Windows)</title>

<para>
Network printing covers a lot of ground. To understand what exactly
goes on with Samba when it is printing on behalf of its Windows
clients, let's first look at a <quote>purely Windows</quote> setup: Windows clients
with a Windows NT print server.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>From Windows Clients to an NT Print Server</title>

<para>
Windows clients printing to an NT-based print server have two
options. They may:
<indexterm><primary>GDI</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>EMF</primary></indexterm>
</para>


<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Execute the driver locally and render the GDI output
			(EMF) into the printer-specific format on their own.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Send the GDI output (EMF) to the server, where the
driver is executed to render the printer specific
output.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Both print paths are shown in the flowcharts <link linkend="small11">Print driver 
execution on the client</link> and <link linkend="small12">Print driver execution on the server</link>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Driver Execution on the Client</title>

<para>
In the first case the print server must spool the file as raw,
meaning it shouldn't touch the jobfile and try to convert it in any
way. This is what a traditional UNIX-based print server can do too, and
at a better performance and more reliably than an NT print server. This
is what most Samba administrators probably are familiar with. One
advantage of this setup is that this <quote>spooling-only</quote> print server may
be used even if no driver(s) for UNIX are available it is sufficient
to have the Windows client drivers available; and installed on the
clients.
</para>

<para>
	<image id="small11"><imagedescription>Print driver execution on the client.</imagedescription>

<indexterm><primary>ESC/P</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>EMF</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>GDI</primary></indexterm>
The other path executes the printer driver on the server. The client
transfers print files in EMF format to the server. The server uses the
PostScript, PCL, ESC/P or other driver to convert the EMF file into
the printer-specific language. It is not possible for UNIX to do the
same. Currently, there is no program or method to convert a Windows
client's GDI output on a UNIX server into something a printer could
understand.

However, there is something similar possible with CUPS. Read on.

</sect2>

<sect1>
<title>Network Printing (Windows Clients &smbmdash; UNIX/Samba Print
Servers)</title>

<para>
Since UNIX print servers <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> execute the Win32
program code on their platform, the picture is somewhat
different. However, this does not limit your options all that
much. On the contrary, you may have a way here to implement printing
features that are not possible otherwise.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>From Windows Clients to a CUPS/Samba Print Server</title>

<para>
Here is a simple recipe showing how you can take advantage of CUPS'
powerful features for the benefit of your Windows network printing
clients:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Let the Windows clients send PostScript to the CUPS
server.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Let the CUPS server render the PostScript into device-specific raster format.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
This requires the clients to use a PostScript driver (even if the
printer is a non-PostScript model. It also requires that you have a
driver on the CUPS server.
</para>

<para>
First, to enable CUPS-based printing through Samba the
following options should be set in your &smb.conf; file [global]
section:
</para>

<smbconfblock>
<smbconfoption><name>printing</name><value>cups</value></smbconfoption>
<smbconfoption><name>printcap</name><value>cups</value></smbconfoption>
</smbconfblock>

<para>
When these parameters are specified, all manually set print directives
(like <smbconfoption><name>print command</name></smbconfoption>, or <smbconfoption><name>lppause command</name></smbconfoption>) in &smb.conf; (as well as
in Samba itself) will be ignored. Instead, Samba will directly
interface with CUPS through its application program interface (API),
as long as Samba has been compiled with CUPS library (libcups)
support. If Samba has not been compiled with CUPS support, and if no
other print commands are set up, then printing will use the
<emphasis>System V</emphasis> AT&amp;T command set, with the -oraw
option automatically passing through (if you want your own defined
print commands to work with a Samba that has CUPS support compiled in,
simply use <smbconfoption><name>printing</name><value>sysv</value></smbconfoption>).
</para>

</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Samba Receiving Job-files and Passing Them to CUPS</title>

<para>
Samba <emphasis>must</emphasis> use its own spool directory (it is set
by a line similar to <smbconfoption><name>path</name><value>/var/spool/samba</value></smbconfoption>,
in the <smbconfsection>[printers]</smbconfsection> or
<smbconfsection>[printername]</smbconfsection> section of
&smb.conf;). Samba receives the job in its own
spool space and passes it into the spool directory of CUPS (the CUPS
spooling directory is set by the <parameter>RequestRoot</parameter>
directive, in a line that defaults to <parameter>RequestRoot
/var/spool/cups</parameter>). CUPS checks the access rights of its
spool dir and resets it to healthy values with every restart. We have
seen quite a few people who had used a common spooling space for Samba
and CUPS, and were struggling for weeks with this <quote>problem.</quote>
</para>

<para>
A Windows user authenticates only to Samba (by whatever means is
configured). If Samba runs on the same host as CUPS, you only need to
allow <quote>localhost</quote> to print. If they run on different machines, you
need to make sure the Samba host gets access to printing on CUPS.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Network PostScript RIP</title>

<para>
This section discusses the use of CUPS filters on the server &smbmdash; configuration where
clients make use of a PostScript driver with CUPS-PPDs.
</para>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>PostScript</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>PCL</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>PJL</primary></indexterm>
PPDs can control all print device options. They are usually provided
by the manufacturer, if you own a PostScript printer, that is. PPD
files (PostScript Printer Descriptions) are always a component of
PostScript printer drivers on MS Windows or Apple Mac OS systems. They
are ASCII files containing user-selectable print options, mapped to
appropriate PostScript, PCL or PJL commands for the target
printer. Printer driver GUI dialogs translate these options
<quote>on-the-fly</quote> into buttons and drop-down lists for the user to select.
</para>

<para>
CUPS can load, without any conversions, the PPD file from any Windows
(NT is recommended) PostScript driver and handle the options. There is
a Web browser interface to the print options (select <ulink
noescape="1" url="http://localhost:631/printers/">http://localhost:631/printers/</ulink>
and click on one <guibutton>Configure Printer</guibutton> button to see
it), or a command line interface (see <command>man lpoptions</command>
or see if you have <command>lphelp</command> on your system). There are also some
different GUI front-ends on Linux/UNIX, which can present PPD options
to users. PPD options are normally meant to be evaluated by the
PostScript RIP on the real PostScript printer.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>PPDs for Non-PS Printers on UNIX</title>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>PPD</primary></indexterm>
CUPS does not limit itself to <quote>real</quote> PostScript printers in its usage
of PPDs. The CUPS developers have extended the scope of the PPD
concept to also describe available device and driver options for
non-PostScript printers through CUPS-PPDs.
</para>

<para>
This is logical, as CUPS includes a fully featured PostScript
interpreter (RIP). This RIP is based on Ghostscript. It can process
all received PostScript (and additionally many other file formats)
from clients. All CUPS-PPDs geared to non-PostScript printers contain
an additional line, starting with the keyword
<parameter>*cupsFilter</parameter>. This line tells the CUPS print
system which printer-specific filter to use for the interpretation of
the supplied PostScript. Thus CUPS lets all its printers appear as
PostScript devices to its clients, because it can act as a PostScript
RIP for those printers, processing the received PostScript code into a
proper raster print format.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>PPDs for Non-PS Printers on Windows</title>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>PPD</primary></indexterm>
CUPS-PPDs can also be used on Windows-Clients, on top of a
<quote>core</quote> PostScript driver (now recommended is the "CUPS PostScript
Driver for Windows NT/200x/XP"; you can also use the Adobe one, with
limitations). This feature enables CUPS to do a few tricks no other
spooler can do:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Act as a networked PostScript RIP (Raster Image
Processor), handling print files from all client platforms in a uniform
way.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Act as a central accounting and billing server, since
all files are passed through the pstops filter and are, therefore,
logged in the CUPS <filename>page_log</filename> file.
<emphasis>Note:</emphasis> this cannot happen with <quote>raw</quote> print jobs,
which always remain unfiltered per definition.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Enable clients to consolidate on a single PostScript
driver, even for many different target printers.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Using CUPS PPDs on Windows clients enables these to control
all print job settings just as a UNIX client can do.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Windows Terminal Servers (WTS) as CUPS Clients</title>

<para>
This setup may be of special interest to people experiencing major
problems in WTS environments. WTS often need a multitude of
non-PostScript drivers installed to run their clients' variety of
different printer models. This often imposes the price of much
increased instability.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Printer Drivers Running in <quote>Kernel Mode</quote> Cause Many
Problems</title>

<para>
	In Windows NT printer drivers which run in <quote>Kernel
Mode</quote>, introduces a high risk for the stability of the system
if the driver is not really stable and well-tested. And there are a
lot of bad drivers out there! Especially notorious is the example
of the PCL printer driver that had an additional sound module
running, to notify users via sound-card of their finished jobs. Do I
need to say that this one was also reliably causing <quote>blue screens
of death</quote> on a regular basis?
</para>

<para>
PostScript drivers are generally well tested. They are not known
to cause any problems, even though they also run in kernel mode. This
might be because there have been so far only two different PostScript
drivers: the ones from Adobe and the one from Microsoft. Both are
well tested and are as stable as you can imagine on
Windows. The CUPS driver is derived from the Microsoft one.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Workarounds Impose Heavy Limitations</title>

<para>
In many cases, in an attempt to work around this problem, site
administrators have resorted to restricting the allowed drivers installed
on their WTS to one generic PCL and one PostScript driver. This,
however, restricts the clients in the number of printer options
available for them. Often they can't get out more than simplex
prints from one standard paper tray, while their devices could do much
better, if driven by a different driver!
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>CUPS: A <quote>Magical Stone</quote>?</title>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>PPD</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>PostScript</primary></indexterm>
Using a PostScript driver, enabled with a CUPS-PPD, seems to be a very
elegant way to overcome all these shortcomings. There are, depending
on the version of Windows OS you use, up to three different PostScript
drivers available: Adobe, Microsoft and CUPS PostScript drivers. None
of them is known to cause major stability problems on WTS (even if
used with many different PPDs). The clients will be able to (again)
chose paper trays, duplex printing and other settings. However, there
is a certain price for this too: a CUPS server acting as a PostScript
RIP for its clients requires more CPU and RAM than when just acting as
a <quote>raw spooling</quote> device. Plus, this setup is not yet widely tested,
although the first feedbacks look very promising.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>PostScript Drivers with No Major Problems &smbmdash; Even in Kernel
Mode</title>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>DDK</primary></indexterm>
More recent printer drivers on W200x and XP no longer run in kernel mode
(unlike Windows NT). However, both operating systems can still
use the NT drivers, running in kernel mode (you can roughly tell which
is which as the drivers in subdirectory <quote>2</quote> of <quote>W32X86</quote> are <quote>old</quote>
ones). As was said before, the Adobe as well as the Microsoft
PostScript drivers are not known to cause any stability problems. The
CUPS driver is derived from the Microsoft one. There is a simple
reason for this: The MS DDK (Device Development Kit) for Windows NT (which
used to be available at no cost to licensees of Visual Studio)
includes the source code of the Microsoft driver, and licensees of
Visual Studio are allowed to use and modify it for their own driver
development efforts. This is what the CUPS people have done. The
license does not allow them to publish the whole of the source code.
However, they have released the <quote>diff</quote> under the GPL, and if you are
the owner of an <quote>MS DDK for Windows NT,</quote> you can check the driver yourself.

As we have said before, all previously known methods to prepare client
printer drivers on the Samba server for download and Point'n'Print
convenience of Windows workstations are working with CUPS, too. These
methods were described in the previous chapter. In reality, this is a
pure Samba business and only relates to the Samba/Windows client

The <command>cupsaddsmb</command> utility (shipped with all current CUPS versions) is an
alternate method to transfer printer drivers into the Samba
<smbconfsection>[print$]</smbconfsection> share. Remember, this share is where
clients expect drivers deposited and setup for download and
installation. It makes the sharing of any (or all) installed CUPS
printers quite easy. <command>cupsaddsmb</command> can use the Adobe PostScript driver as
well as the newly developed CUPS PostScript Driver for
Windows NT/200x/XP. <parameter>cupsaddsmb</parameter> does
<emphasis>not</emphasis> work with arbitrary vendor printer drivers,
but only with the <emphasis>exact</emphasis> driver files that are
named in its man page.
</para>

<para>
The CUPS printer driver is available from the CUPS download site. Its
package name is <filename>cups-samba-[version].tar.gz</filename> . It
is preferred over the Adobe drivers since it has a number of
advantages:

This new CUPS PostScript driver is currently binary-only, but free of
charge. No complete source code is provided (yet). The reason is that
it has been developed with the help of the Microsoft Driver
Developer Kit (DDK) and compiled with Microsoft Visual
Studio 6. Driver developers are not allowed to distribute the whole of
the source code as free software. However, CUPS developers released
the <quote>diff</quote> in source code under the GPL, so anybody with a license of
Visual Studio and a DDK will be able to compile for him/herself.

<title>Acquiring the Adobe Driver Files</title>

<para>
Acquiring the Adobe driver files seems to be unexpectedly difficult
for many users. They are not available on the Adobe Web site as single
files and the self-extracting and/or self-installing Windows-.exe is
not easy to locate either. Probably you need to use the included
native installer and run the installation process on one client
once. This will install the drivers (and one Generic PostScript
printer) locally on the client. When they are installed, share the
Generic PostScript printer. After this, the client's
<smbconfsection>[print$]</smbconfsection> share holds the Adobe files, from
where you can get them with smbclient from the CUPS host.

<para>
<indexterm><primary>ESP</primary><secondary>Print Pro</secondary></indexterm>
Users of the ESP Print Pro software are able to install their Samba

files from the normal download area of the ESP Print Pro software
at <ulink

You need to locate the link labeled <quote>SAMBA</quote> among the
<guilabel>Download Printer Drivers for ESP Print Pro 4.x</guilabel>
area and download the package. Once installed, you can prepare any
driver by simply highlighting the printer in the Printer Manager GUI
and select <guilabel>Export Driver...</guilabel> from the menu. Of
course you need to have prepared Samba beforehand to handle the
driver files; i.e., setup the <smbconfsection>[print$]</smbconfsection>
share, and so on. The ESP Print Pro package includes the CUPS driver files
as well as a (licensed) set of Adobe drivers for the Windows 95/98/Me
client family.

<indexterm><primary>cupsaddsmb</primary></indexterm>
Once you have run the install script (and possibly manually
moved the <filename>cups.hlp</filename> file to
<filename>/usr/share/cups/drivers/</filename>), the driver is
ready to be put into Samba's <smbconfsection>[print$]</smbconfsection> share (which often maps to
<filename>/etc/samba/drivers/</filename> and contains a subdirectory
tree with <emphasis>WIN40</emphasis> and
<emphasis>W32X86</emphasis> branches). You do this by running
<command>cupsaddsmb</command> (see also <command>man cupsaddsmb</command> for
CUPS since release 1.1.16).
</para>

<tip><para>
<indexterm><primary>Single Sign On</primary></indexterm>
You may need to put root into the smbpasswd file by running

<emphasis>single sign on</emphasis> to a Windows Domain Controller.
</para></tip>

<para>
Once the driver files are in the <smbconfsection>[print$]</smbconfsection> share
and are initialized, they are ready to be downloaded and installed by
the Windows NT/200x/XP clients.

Win 9x/Me clients will not work with the CUPS PostScript driver. For

<note>
<para>
It is not harmful if you still have the
<filename>ADOBE*.*</filename> driver files from previous
installations in the <filename>/usr/share/cups/drivers/</filename>

automatically prefer its own drivers if it finds both.
</para></note>

<note><para>
<indexterm><primary>"Printers" folder</primary></indexterm>
Should your Windows clients have had the old <filename>ADOBE*.*</filename>
files for the Adobe PostScript driver installed, the download and
installation of the new CUPS PostScript driver for Windows NT/200x/XP
will fail at first. You need to wipe the old driver from the clients
first. It is not enough to <quote>delete</quote> the printer, as the driver files
will still be kept by the clients and re-used if you try to re-install
the printer. To really get rid of the Adobe driver files on the
clients, open the <guilabel>Printers</guilabel> folder (possibly via <guilabel>Start > Settings > Control Panel > Printers</guilabel>),
right-click on the folder background and select <guimenuitem>Server
Properties</guimenuitem>. When the new dialog opens, select the
<guilabel>Drivers</guilabel> tab. On the list select the driver you
want to delete and click the <guilabel>Delete</guilabel>
button. This will only work if there is not one single printer left
that uses that particular driver. You need to <quote>delete</quote> all printers
using this driver in the <guilabel>Printers</guilabel> folder first. You will need
Administrator privileges to do this.

<title>Windows CUPS PostScript Driver Versus Adobe Driver</title>

<para>
Are you interested in a comparison between the CUPS and the Adobe
PostScript drivers? For our purposes these are the most important
items that weigh in favor of the CUPS ones:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>No hassle with the Adobe EULA.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>No hassle with the question <quote>Where do I
get the ADOBE*.* driver files from?</quote></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
<indexterm><primary>PJL</primary></indexterm>
The Adobe drivers (on request of the printer PPD
associated with them) often put a PJL header in front of the main
PostScript part of the print file. Thus, the printfile starts with
<parameter>&lt;1B &gt;%-12345X</parameter> or
<parameter>&lt;escape&gt;%-12345X</parameter> instead
of <parameter>%!PS</parameter>). This leads to the
CUPS daemon auto-typing the incoming file as a print-ready file,
not initiating a pass through the <parameter>pstops</parameter> filter (to speak more
technically, it is not regarded as the generic MIME-type 
<indexterm><primary>application/postscript</primary></indexterm>
<parameter>application/postscript</parameter>, but as
the more special MIME type
<indexterm><primary>application/cups.vnd-postscript</primary></indexterm>
<parameter>application/cups.vnd-postscript</parameter>),
which therefore also leads to the page accounting in
<parameter>/var/log/cups/page_log</parameter> not
receiving the exact number of pages; instead the dummy page number
of <quote>1</quote> is logged in a standard setup).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The Adobe driver has more options to mis-configure the
PostScript generated by it (like setting it inadvertently to
<guilabel>Optimize for Speed</guilabel>, instead of
<guilabel>Optimize for Portability</guilabel>, which
could lead to CUPS being unable to process it).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The CUPS PostScript driver output sent by Windows
clients to the CUPS server is guaranteed to auto-type 
as the generic MIME type <parameter>application/postscript</parameter>,
thus passing through the CUPS <parameter>pstops</parameter> filter and logging the
correct number of pages in the <filename>page_log</filename> for
accounting and quota purposes.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The CUPS PostScript driver supports the sending of
additional standard (IPP) print options by Windows NT/200x/XP clients. Such
additional print options are: naming the CUPS standard
<emphasis>banner pages</emphasis> (or the custom ones, should they be
installed at the time of driver download), using the CUPS
page-label option, setting a
job-priority, and setting the scheduled
time of printing (with the option to support additional
useful IPP job attributes in the future).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The CUPS PostScript driver supports the inclusion of
the new <parameter>*cupsJobTicket</parameter> comments at the
beginning of the PostScript file (which could be used in the future
for all sort of beneficial extensions on the CUPS side, but which will
not disturb any other applications as they will regard it as a comment
and simply ignore it).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The CUPS PostScript driver will be the heart of the

The <command>cupsaddsmb</command> command copies the needed files into your
<smbconfsection>[print$]</smbconfsection> share. Additionally, the PPD
associated with this printer is copied from
<filename>/etc/cups/ppd/</filename> to
<smbconfsection>[print$]</smbconfsection>. There the files wait for convenient
Windows client installations via Point'n'Print. Before we can run the
command successfully, we need to be sure that we can authenticate
toward Samba. If you have a small network, you are probably using user-level
security (<smbconfoption><name>security</name><value>user</value></smbconfoption>).

These messages are probably not easily recognized in the general

parameter (which tries to prepare <emphasis>all</emphasis> active CUPS
printer drivers for download), you might miss if individual printers
drivers had problems installing properly. Here a redirection of the
output will help you analyze the results in retrospective.
</para>

<para>
If you get:
<screen>
SetPrinter call failed!
result was WERR_ACCESS_DENIED
</screen>
It means that you might have set <smbconfoption><name>use client driver</name><value>yes</value></smbconfoption> for this printer.

<command>cupsaddsmb</command> will only reliably work with CUPS version 1.1.15 or higher

driver download to the clients does not succeed, you can still manually
install the CUPS printer PPD on top of the Adobe PostScript driver on
clients. Then point the client's printer queue to the Samba printer
share for a UNC type of connection:

<title>Avoiding Critical PostScript Driver Settings on the Client</title>

<para>
Printing works, but there are still problems. Most jobs print
well, some do not print at all. Some jobs have problems with fonts,
which do not look very good. Some jobs print fast and some are
dead-slow. Many of these problems can be greatly reduced or even
completely eliminated if you follow a few guidelines. Remember, if
your print device is not PostScript-enabled, you are treating your
Ghostscript installation on your CUPS host with the output your client
driver settings produce. Treat it well:

We are going to do this now. First, read the man page on <parameter>rpcclient</parameter>
to get a first idea. Look at all the printing related
subcommands. <command>enumprinters</command>,
<command>enumdrivers</command>, <command>enumports</command>,
<command>adddriver</command>, <command>setdriver</command> are among
the most interesting ones. <parameter>rpcclient</parameter> implements an important part of
the MS-RPC protocol. You can use it to query (and command) a Windows NT
(or 200x/XP) PC, too. MS-RPC is used by Windows clients, among other
things, to benefit from the Point'n'Print features. Samba can now
mimic this as well.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>A Check of the rpcclient man Page</title>

<para>
	First let's check the <parameter>rpcclient</parameter> man page. Here are
two relevant passages:
</para>

<para>
<command>adddriver &lt;arch&gt; &lt;config&gt;</command> Execute an
<command>AddPrinterDriver()</command> RPC to install the printer driver information on
the server. The driver files should already exist in the
directory returned by <command>getdriverdir</command>. Possible
values for <parameter>arch</parameter> are the same as those for the
<command>getdriverdir</command> command. The
<parameter>config</parameter> parameter is defined as follows:
</para>
		
<para><screen>
Long Printer Name:\
Driver File Name:\
Data File Name:\
Config File Name:\
Help File Name:\
Language Monitor Name:\
Default Data Type:\
Comma Separated list of Files
</screen></para>

<para>Any empty fields should be enter as the string <quote>NULL</quote>. </para>

<para>Samba does not need to support the concept of Print Monitors
since these only apply to local printers whose driver can make use of
a bi-directional link for communication. This field should be <quote>NULL</quote>.
On a remote NT print server, the Print Monitor for a driver must
already be installed prior to adding the driver or else the RPC will
fail.
</para>

<para>
<command>setdriver &lt;printername&gt; &lt;drivername&gt;</command>
Execute a <command>SetPrinter()</command> command to update the
printer driver associated with an installed printer. The printer
driver must already be correctly installed on the print server.
</para>

<para>See also the <command>enumprinters</command> and <command>enumdrivers</command> commands for
obtaining a list of installed printers and drivers.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Understanding the rpcclient man Page</title>

<para>
The <emphasis>exact</emphasis> format isn't made too clear by the man
page, since you have to deal with some parameters containing
spaces. Here is a better description for it. We have line-broken the
command and indicated the breaks with <quote>\</quote>. Usually you would type the
command in one line without the line-breaks:
<indexterm><primary>rpcclient</primary><secondary>adddriver</secondary></indexterm>
</para>

<para><screen>
 adddriver "Architecture" \
           "LongPrinterName:DriverFile:DataFile:ConfigFile:HelpFile:\
           LanguageMonitorFile:DataType:ListOfFiles,Comma-separated"
</screen></para>

<para>
What the man pages denote as a simple <parameter>&lt;config&gt;</parameter>
keyword, in reality consists of eight colon-separated fields. The
last field may take multiple (in some very insane cases, even
20 different additional) files. This might sound confusing at first.
What the man pages names the <quote>LongPrinterName</quote> in
reality should be called the <quote>Driver Name</quote>. You can name it
anything you want, as long as you use this name later in the
<command>rpcclient ... setdriver</command> command. For
practical reasons, many name the driver the same as the
printer.
</para>

<para>
It isn't simple at all. I hear you asking:
<quote>How do I know which files are "Driver
File</quote>, <quote>Data File</quote>, <quote>Config File</quote>, <quote>Help File</quote> and <quote>Language
Monitor File" in each case?</quote> &smbmdash; For an answer, you may
want to have a look at how a Windows NT box with a shared printer
presents the files to us. Remember, that this whole procedure has
to be developed by the Samba team by overhearing the traffic caused
by Windows computers on the wire. We may as well turn to a Windows
box now and access it from a UNIX workstation. We will query it
with <command>rpcclient</command> to see what it tells us and
try to understand the man page more clearly that we've read just
now.

We could run <command>rpcclient</command> with a

subcommand (in level 3 verbosity) against it. Just sit down at a UNIX or

<para>
Some printer drivers list additional files under the label

<title>Manual Driver Installation in 15 Steps</title>

You cannot repeat this step if it fails. It could fail even

the driver files into the <quote>2</quote> subdirectory. If this step fails, you
need to go back to the fourth step and repeat it before you can try
this one again. In this step, you need to choose a name for your
driver. It is normally a good idea to use the same name as is used for
the printer name; however, in big installations you may use this driver
for a number of printers that obviously have different names, so the
name of the driver is not fixed.

You certainly know how to install the driver on the client. In case
you are not particularly familiar with Windows, here is a short
recipe: Browse the Network Neighborhood, go to the Samba server, and look
for the shares. You should see all shared Samba printers.
Double-click on the one in question. The driver should get
installed and the network connection set up. An alternate way is to
open the <guilabel>Printers (and Faxes)</guilabel> folder, right-click on the printer in
question and select <guilabel>Connect</guilabel> or <guilabel>Install</guilabel>. As a result, a new printer
should have appeared in your client's local <guilabel>Printers (and Faxes)</guilabel>
folder, named something like <guilabel>printersharename on Sambahostname</guilabel>.

It is important that you execute this step as a Samba printer admin

The setdriver command will fail, if in Samba's mind the queue is not

after the <command>adddriver</command> parts of the procedure?  But you are also seeing
a disappointing message like this one?

It is not good enough that you
can see the queue in CUPS, using
the <command>lpstat -p ir85wm</command> command. A
bug in most recent versions of Samba prevents the proper update of
the queue-list. The recognition of newly installed CUPS printers
fails unless you restart Samba or send a HUP to all smbd
processes. To verify if this is the reason why Samba does not
execute the <command>setdriver</command> command successfully, check if Samba <quote>sees</quote>

<title>Trivial Database Files</title>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>TDB</primary></indexterm>
A Windows NT (print) server keeps track of all information needed to serve
its duty toward its clients by storing entries in the Windows
registry. Client queries are answered by reading from the registry,
Administrator or user configuration settings that are saved by writing into
the registry. Samba and UNIX obviously do not have such a
Registry. Samba instead keeps track of all client related information in a
series of <filename>*.tdb</filename> files. (TDB = Trivial Data
Base). These are often located in <filename>/var/lib/samba/</filename>
or <filename>/var/lock/samba/</filename>. The printing related files
are <filename>ntprinters.tdb</filename>,
<filename>printing.tdb</filename>,<filename>ntforms.tdb</filename> and
<filename>ntdrivers.tdb</filename>.

<title>Binary Format</title>

<para>
<filename>*.tdb</filename> files are not human readable. They are
written in a binary format. <quote>Why not ASCII?</quote>, you may ask. <quote>After all,
ASCII configuration files are a good and proven tradition on UNIX.</quote>
The reason for this design decision by the Samba team is mainly
performance. Samba needs to be fast; it runs a separate
<command>smbd</command> process for each client connection, in some
environments many thousands of them. Some of these smbds might need to
write-access the same <filename>*.tdb</filename> file <emphasis>at the
same time</emphasis>. The file format of Samba's
<filename>*.tdb</filename> files allows for this provision. Many smbd
processes may write to the same <filename>*.tdb</filename> file at the
same time. This wouldn't be possible with pure ASCII files.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Losing <filename>*.tdb</filename> Files</title>

<para>
It is very important that all <filename>*.tdb</filename> files remain
consistent over all write and read accesses. However, it may happen
that these files <emphasis>do</emphasis> get corrupted. (A
<command>kill -9 `pidof smbd'</command> while a write access is in
progress could do the damage as well as a power interruption,
etc.). In cases of trouble, a deletion of the old printing-related
<filename>*.tdb</filename> files may be the only option. After that you need to
re-create all print-related setup or you have made a
backup of the <filename>*.tdb</filename> files in time.

<title>CUPS Print Drivers from Linuxprinting.org</title>

CUPS ships with good support for HP LaserJet-type printers. You can
install the generic driver as follows:

	<screen>
&rootprompt;<userinput>lpadmin -p laserjet4plus -v parallel:/dev/lp0 -E -m laserjet.ppd</userinput>

<para>
The <option>-m</option> switch will retrieve the
<filename>laserjet.ppd</filename> from the standard repository for
not-yet-installed-PPDs, which CUPS typically stores in
<filename>/usr/share/cups/model</filename>. Alternately, you may use
<option>-P /path/to/your.ppd</option>.
</para>

<para>
The generic <filename>laserjet.ppd,</filename> however, does not support every special option
for every LaserJet-compatible model. It constitutes a sort of <quote>least common
denominator</quote> of all the models. If for some reason
you must pay for the commercially available ESP Print Pro drivers, your
first move should be to consult the database on the
<ulink noescape="1" url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi">Linuxprinting</ulink> web site.
Linuxprinting.org has excellent recommendations about which driver is
best used for each printer. Its database is kept current by the
tireless work of Till Kamppeter from MandrakeSoft, who is also the
principal author of the <command>foomatic-rip</command> utility.

The former <command>cupsomatic</command> concept is now being replaced by the new

If you upgrade to <command>foomatic-rip</command>, remember to also upgrade to the
new-style PPDs for your Foomatic-driven printers. foomatic-rip will
not work with PPDs generated for the old <command>cupsomatic</command>. The new-style
PPDs are 100% compliant to the Adobe PPD specification. They are
also intended to be used by Samba and the cupsaddsmb utility, to

Nowadays, most Linux distributions rely on the utilities of Linuxprinting.org
to create their printing-related software (which, by the way, works on all
UNIXes and on Mac OS X or Darwin, too). It is not known as well as it
should be, that it also has a very end-user-friendly interface that
allows for an easy update of drivers and PPDs for all supported
models, all spoolers, all operating systems, and all package formats
(because there is none). Its history goes back a few years.
</para>

<para>
Recently, Foomatic has achieved the astonishing milestone of <ulink
url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi?make=Anyone">1000
listed</ulink> printer models. Linuxprinting.org keeps all the
important facts about printer drivers, supported models and which
options are available for the various driver/printer combinations in
its <ulink
url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html">Foomatic</ulink>
database. Currently there are <ulink
url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/driver_list.cgi">245 drivers</ulink>
in the database. Many drivers support various models, and many models
may be driven by different drivers &smbmdash; its your choice!

<title>690 <quote>Perfect</quote> Printers</title>

<para>
At present, there are 690 devices dubbed as working perfectly, 181
mostly, 96 partially, and 46 are paperweights. Keeping in mind
that most of these are non-PostScript models (PostScript printers are
automatically supported by CUPS to perfection, by using
their own manufacturer-provided Windows-PPD), and that a
multi-functional device never qualifies as working perfectly if it
does not also scan and copy and fax under GNU/Linux &smbmdash; then this is a
truly astonishing achievement! Three years ago the number was not
more than 500, and Linux or UNIX printing at the time wasn't
anywhere near the quality it is today.

<title>How the Printing HOWTO Started It All</title>

<para>
A few years ago <ulink url="http://www2.picante.com:81/~gtaylor/">Grant Taylor</ulink>
started it all. The roots of today's Linuxprinting.org are in the
first <ulink url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic2.9/howto/">Linux Printing
HOWTO</ulink> that he authored. As a side-project to this document,
which served many Linux users and Admins to guide their first steps in
this complicated and delicate setup (to a scientist, printing is
<quote>applying a structured deposition of distinct patterns of ink or toner
particles on paper substrates</quote>, he started to
build in a little Postgres database with information about the
hardware and driver zoo that made up Linux printing of the time. This
database became the core component of today's Foomatic collection of
tools and data. In the meantime, it has moved to an XML representation
of the data.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Foomatic's Strange Name</title>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>foomatic</primary></indexterm>
<quote>Why the funny name?</quote> you ask. When it really took off, around spring
2000, CUPS was far less popular than today, and most systems used LPD,
LPRng or even PDQ to print. CUPS shipped with a few generic drivers
(good for a few hundred different printer models). These didn't
support many device-specific options. CUPS also shipped with its own
built-in rasterization filter (<parameter>pstoraster</parameter>, derived from
Ghostscript). On the other hand, CUPS provided brilliant support for
<emphasis>controlling</emphasis> all printer options through
standardized and well-defined PPD files (PostScript Printers
Description files). Plus, CUPS was designed to be easily extensible.
</para>

<para>
Taylor already had in his database a respectable compilation
of facts about many more printers and the Ghostscript <quote>drivers</quote>
they run with. His idea, to generate PPDs from the database information
and use them to make standard Ghostscript filters work within CUPS,
proved to work very well. It also killed several birds with one
stone:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>It made all current and future Ghostscript filter
developments available for CUPS.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>It made available a lot of additional printer models
to CUPS users (because often the traditional Ghostscript way of
printing was the only one available).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>It gave all the advanced CUPS options (Web interface,
GUI driver configurations) to users wanting (or needing) to use
Ghostscript filters.</para></listitem>

<title>cupsomatic, pdqomatic, lpdomatic, directomatic</title>

<indexterm><primary>CUPS-PPD</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>PPD</primary><secondary>CUPS</secondary><see>CUPS-PPD</see></indexterm>
CUPS worked through a quickly-hacked up filter script named <ulink
url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/download.cgi?filename=cupsomatic&amp;show=0">cupsomatic.</ulink>
cupsomatic ran the printfile through Ghostscript, constructing
automatically the rather complicated command line needed. It just
needed to be copied into the CUPS system to make it work. To
configure the way cupsomatic controls the Ghostscript rendering
process, it needs a CUPS-PPD. This PPD is generated directly from the
contents of the database. For CUPS and the respective printer/filter
combo, another Perl script named CUPS-O-Matic did the PPD
generation. After that was working, Taylor implemented within a few
days a similar thing for two other spoolers. Names chosen for the
config-generator scripts were <ulink
url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/download.cgi?filename=lpdomatic&amp;show=0">PDQ-O-Matic</ulink>
(for PDQ) and <ulink
url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/download.cgi?filename=lpdomatic&amp;show=0">LPD-O-Matic</ulink>
(for &smbmdash; you guessed it &smbmdash; LPD); the configuration here didn't use PPDs
but other spooler-specific files.
</para>

<para>
From late summer of that year, <ulink url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/till/">Till Kamppeter</ulink>
started to put work into the database. Kamppeter had been newly employed by
<ulink url="http://www.mandrakesoft.com/">MandrakeSoft</ulink> to
convert its printing system over to CUPS, after they had seen his
<ulink url="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</ulink>-based <ulink
url="http://cups.sourceforge.net/xpp/">XPP</ulink> (a GUI front-end to
the CUPS lp-command). He added a huge amount of new information and new
printers. He also developed the support for other spoolers, like
<ulink url="http://ppr.sourceforge.net/">PPR</ulink> (via ppromatic),
<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpr/">GNUlpr</ulink> and
<ulink url="http://www.lprng.org/">LPRng</ulink> (both via an extended
lpdomatic) and spooler-less printing (<ulink
url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/download.cgi?filename=directomatic&amp;show=0">directomatic</ulink>).
</para>

<para>
So, to answer your question: <quote>Foomatic</quote> is the general name for all
the overlapping code and data behind the <quote>*omatic</quote> scripts.
Foomatic, up to versions 2.0.x, required (ugly) Perl data structures
attached to Linuxprinting.org PPDs for CUPS. It had a different
<quote>*omatic</quote> script for every spooler, as well as different printer
configuration files.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>The <emphasis>Grand Unification</emphasis> Achieved</title>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>foomatic-rip</primary></indexterm>
This has all changed in Foomatic versions 2.9 (beta) and released as
<quote>stable</quote> 3.0. It has now achieved the convergence of all *omatic
scripts and is called the <ulink
url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic2.9/download.cgi?filename=foomatic-rip&amp;show=0">foomatic-rip.</ulink>
This single script is the unification of the previously different
spooler-specific *omatic scripts. foomatic-rip is used by all the
different spoolers alike and because it can read PPDs (both the
original PostScript printer PPDs and the Linuxprinting.org-generated
ones), all of a sudden all supported spoolers can have the power of
PPDs at their disposal. Users only need to plug foomatic-rip into
their system. For users there is improved media type and source
support &smbmdash; paper sizes and trays are easier to configure.
</para>

<para>
Also, the New Generation of Linuxprinting.org PPDs no longer contains
Perl data structures. If you are a distro maintainer and have
used the previous version of Foomatic, you may want to give the new
one a spin, but remember to generate a new-version set of PPDs
via the new <ulink
url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/foomatic/foomatic-db-engine-3.0.0beta1.tar.gz">foomatic-db-engine!</ulink>
Individual users just need to generate a single new PPD specific to
their model by <ulink
url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/II.Foomatic-User/II.tutorial-handout-foomatic-user.html">following
the steps</ulink> outlined in the Foomatic tutorial or in this chapter. This new development is truly amazing.
</para>

<para>
foomatic-rip is a very clever wrapper around the need to run
Ghostscript with a different syntax, options, device selections, and/or filters for each different printer
or spooler. At the same time it can read the PPD associated
with a print queue and modify the print job according to the user
selections. Together with this comes the 100% compliance of the new
Foomatic PPDs with the Adobe spec. Some innovative features of
the Foomatic concept may surprise users. It will support custom paper
sizes for many printers and will support printing on media drawn
from different paper trays within the same job (in both cases, even
where there is no support for this from Windows-based vendor printer
drivers).
</para>

<sect3>
<title>Driver Development Outside</title>

<para>
Most driver development itself does not happen within
Linuxprinting.org. Drivers are written by independent maintainers.
Linuxprinting.org just pools all the information and stores it in its
database. In addition, it also provides the Foomatic glue to integrate
the many drivers into any modern (or legacy) printing system known to
the world.
</para>

<para>
Speaking of the different driver development groups, most of
the work is currently done in three projects. These are:
</para>

better than the vendor drivers provided by Epson for the Microsoft
platforms). This currently supports 522 models.</para></listitem>

or solve printing problems in its popular <ulink

it's not just for GNU/Linux users, but admins of <ulink

OS X forum</ulink> has turned out to be one of the most frequented
forums after only a few weeks.
</para>

<para>
Linuxprinting.org and the Foomatic driver wrappers around Ghostscript
are now a standard tool-chain for printing on all the important
distros. Most of them also have CUPS underneath. While in recent years
most printer data had been added by Kamppeter (who works at Mandrake), many
additional contributions came from engineers with SuSE, Red Hat,
Conectiva, Debian, and others. Vendor-neutrality is an important goal
of the Foomatic project.

<title>Foomatic Database-Generated PPDs</title>

<para>
The Foomatic database is an amazing piece of ingenuity in itself. Not
only does it keep the printer and driver information, but it is
organized in a way that it can generate PPD files on the fly from
its internal XML-based datasets. While these PPDs are modeled to the
Adobe specification of PostScript Printer Descriptions (PPDs), the
Linuxprinting.org/Foomatic-PPDs do not normally drive PostScript
printers. They are used to describe all the bells and whistles you
could ring or blow on an Epson Stylus inkjet, or a HP Photosmart, or
what-have-you. The main trick is one little additional line, not
envisaged by the PPD specification, starting with the <parameter>*cupsFilter</parameter>
keyword. It tells the CUPS daemon how to proceed with the PostScript
print file (old-style Foomatic-PPDs named the
cupsomatic filter script, while the new-style
PPDs are now call foomatic-rip). This filter
script calls Ghostscript on the host system (the recommended variant
is ESP Ghostscript) to do the rendering work. foomatic-rip knows which
filter or internal device setting it should ask from Ghostscript to
convert the PostScript print job into a raster format ready for the
target device. This usage of PPDs to describe the options of non-PS
printers was the invention of the CUPS developers. The rest is easy.
GUI tools (like KDE's marvelous <ulink
url="http://printing.kde.org/overview/kprinter.phtml">kprinter,</ulink>
or the GNOME <ulink
url="http://gtklp.sourceforge.net/">gtklp,</ulink> xpp and the CUPS
Web interface) read the PPD as well and use this information to present
the available settings to the user as an intuitive menu selection.

<title>Page Accounting with CUPS</title>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>CUPS</primary><secondary>Page Accounting</secondary></indexterm>
Often there are questions regarding print quotas where Samba users
(that is, Windows clients) should not be able to print beyond a
certain number of pages or data volume per day, week or month. This
feature is dependent on the real print subsystem you're using.
Samba's part is always to receive the job files from the clients
(filtered <emphasis>or</emphasis> unfiltered) and hand it over to this
printing subsystem.
</para>

<para>
Of course one could hack things with one's own scripts. But then
there is CUPS. CUPS supports quotas that can be based on the size of
jobs or on the number of pages or both, and span any time
period you want.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Setting Up Quotas</title>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>CUPS</primary><secondary>quotas</secondary></indexterm>
This is an example command of how root would set a print quota in CUPS,
assuming an existing printer named <quote>quotaprinter</quote>:
</para>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>lpadmin</primary></indexterm>
	<screen>
&rootprompt;<userinput>lpadmin -p quotaprinter -o job-quota-period=604800 \
	-o job-k-limit=1024 -o job-page-limit=100</userinput>
</screen></para>

<para>
This would limit every single user to print 100 pages or 1024 KB of
data (whichever comes first) within the last 604,800 seconds ( = 1
week).
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Correct and Incorrect Accounting</title>

<para>
For CUPS to count correctly, the printfile needs to pass the CUPS
pstops filter, otherwise it uses a dummy count of <quote>one</quote>. Some
print files do not pass it (e.g., image files) but then those are mostly one-
page jobs anyway. This also means that proprietary drivers for the
target printer running on the client computers and CUPS/Samba, which
then spool these files as <quote>raw</quote> (i.e., leaving them untouched, not
filtering them), will be counted as one-pagers too!
</para>

<para>
You need to send PostScript from the clients (i.e., run a PostScript
driver there) to have the chance to get accounting done. If the
printer is a non-PostScript model, you need to let CUPS do the job to
convert the file to a print-ready format for the target printer. This
is currently working for about a thousand different printer models.

<title>Adobe and CUPS PostScript Drivers for Windows Clients</title>

<para>
Before CUPS 1.1.16, your only option was to use the Adobe PostScript
Driver on the Windows clients. The output of this driver was not
always passed through the <command>pstops</command> filter on the CUPS/Samba side, and
therefore was not counted correctly (the reason is that it often,
depending on the PPD being used, wrote a PJL-header in front of
the real PostScript which caused CUPS to skip <command>pstops</command> and go directly
to the <command>pstoraster</command> stage).
</para>

<para>
From CUPS 1.1.16 onward, you can use the CUPS PostScript Driver for
Windows <?latex \linebreak ?>NT/200x/XP clients (which is tagged in the download area of
<filename>http://www.cups.org/</filename> as the <filename>cups-samba-1.1.16.tar.gz</filename>
package). It does <emphasis>not</emphasis> work for Windows 9x/ME clients, but it guarantees:

<title>Additional Material</title>

<para>
A printer queue with <emphasis>no</emphasis> PPD associated to it is a
<quote>raw</quote> printer and all files will go directly there as received by the
spooler. The exceptions are file types <parameter>application/octet-stream</parameter>
that need pass-through feature enabled. <quote>Raw</quote> queues do not do any
filtering at all, they hand the file directly to the CUPS backend.
This backend is responsible for sending the data to the device
(as in the <quote>device URI</quote> notation: <filename>lpd://, socket://,
smb://, ipp://, http://, parallel:/, serial:/, usb:/</filename>, and so on).
</para>

<para>
cupsomatic/Foomatic are <emphasis>not</emphasis> native CUPS drivers
and they do not ship with CUPS. They are a third party add-on
developed at Linuxprinting.org. As such, they are a brilliant hack to
make all models (driven by Ghostscript drivers/filters in traditional
spoolers) also work via CUPS, with the same (good or bad!) quality as
in these other spoolers. <parameter>cupsomatic</parameter> is only a vehicle to execute a
Ghostscript command-line at that stage in the CUPS filtering chain,
where normally the native CUPS <parameter>pstoraster</parameter> filter would kick
in. cupsomatic bypasses pstoraster, kidnaps the printfile from CUPS
away and redirects it to go through Ghostscript. CUPS accepts this,
because the associated cupsomatic/foomatic-PPD specifies:

<filterline>
  *cupsFilter:  "application/vnd.cups-postscript 0 cupsomatic"
</filterline>

This line persuades CUPS to hand the file to cupsomatic, once it has
successfully converted it to the MIME type
<parameter>application/vnd.cups-postscript</parameter>. This conversion will not happen for
Jobs arriving from Windows that are auto-typed
<parameter>application/octet-stream</parameter>, with the according changes in
<filename>/etc/cups/mime.types</filename> in place.
</para>

<para>
CUPS is widely configurable and flexible, even regarding its filtering
mechanism. Another workaround in some situations would be to have in
<filename>/etc/cups/mime.types</filename> entries as follows:

<filterline>
 application/postscript           application/vnd.cups-raw  0  -
 application/vnd.cups-postscript  application/vnd.cups-raw  0  -
</filterline>

This would prevent all PostScript files from being filtered (rather,
they will through the virtual <emphasis>nullfilter</emphasis>
denoted with <quote>-</quote>). This could only be useful for PS printers. If you
want to print PS code on non-PS printers (provided they support ASCII
text printing), an entry as follows could be useful:

<filterline>
 */*           application/vnd.cups-raw  0  -
</filterline>

and would effectively send <emphasis>all</emphasis> files to the
backend without further processing.
</para>

<para>
You could have the following entry:

<filterline>
application/vnd.cups-postscript application/vnd.cups-raw 0 \
	my_PJL_stripping_filter
</filterline>

You will need to write a <parameter>my_PJL_stripping_filter</parameter>
(which could be a shell script) that parses the PostScript and removes the
unwanted PJL. This needs to conform to CUPS filter design
(mainly, receive and pass the parameters printername, job-id,
username, jobtitle, copies, print options and possibly the
filename). It is installed as world executable into
<filename>/usr/lib/cups/filters/</filename> and is called by CUPS
if it encounters a MIME type <parameter>application/vnd.cups-postscript</parameter>.
</para>

<para>
CUPS can handle <parameter>-o job-hold-until=indefinite</parameter>.
This keeps the job in the queue on hold. It will only be printed
upon manual release by the printer operator. This is a requirement in
many central reproduction departments, where a few operators manage
the jobs of hundreds of users on some big machine, where no user is
allowed to have direct access (such as when the operators often need
to load the proper paper type before running the 10,000 page job
requested by marketing for the mailing, and so on).

<listitem><para>
This keeps some details of jobs in cupsd's mind (well it keeps the
c12345, c12346, and so on, files in the CUPS spool directory, which do a
similar job as the old-fashioned BSD-LPD control files). This is set
to <quote>Yes</quote> as a default.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>PreserveJobFiles Yes</term>
<listitem><para>
This keeps the job files themselves in cupsd's mind
(it keeps the d12345, d12346 etc. files in the CUPS spool
directory). This is set to <quote>No</quote> as the CUPS
default.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><emphasis><quote>MaxJobs 500</quote></emphasis></term>
<listitem><para>
This directive controls the maximum number of jobs
that are kept in memory. Once the number of jobs reaches the limit,
the oldest completed job is automatically purged from the system to
make room for the new one. If all of the known jobs are still
pending or active, then the new job will be rejected. Setting the
maximum to 0 disables this functionality. The default setting is
0.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<parameter>MaxJobsPerPrinter</parameter>...)

<title>Printing from CUPS to Windows Attached Printers</title>

>From time to time the question arises, how can you print
<emphasis>to</emphasis> a Windows attached printer
<emphasis>from</emphasis> Samba? Normally the local connection
from Windows host to printer would be done by USB or parallel
cable, but this does not matter to Samba. From here only an SMB
connection needs to be opened to the Windows host. Of course, this
printer must be shared first. As you have learned by now, CUPS uses
<emphasis>backends</emphasis> to talk to printers and other
servers. To talk to Windows shared printers, you need to use the
<filename>smb</filename> (surprise, surprise!) backend. Check if this
is in the CUPS backend directory. This usually resides in
<filename>/usr/lib/cups/backend/</filename>. You need to find an <filename>smb</filename>
file there. It should be a symlink to <filename>smbspool</filename>
and the file must exist and be executable:

<command>smbspool</command> has been written by Mike Sweet from the CUPS folks. It is
included and ships with Samba. It may also be used with print
subsystems other than CUPS, to spool jobs to Windows printer shares. To
set up printer <replaceable>winprinter</replaceable> on CUPS, you need to have a driver for
it. Essentially this means to convert the print data on the CUPS/Samba
host to a format that the printer can digest (the Windows host is
unable to convert any files you may send). This also means you should
be able to print to the printer if it were hooked directly at your
Samba/CUPS host. For troubleshooting purposes, this is what you
should do to determine if that part of the process chain is in
order. Then proceed to fix the network connection/authentication to
the Windows host, and so on.
</para>

<para>
To install a printer with the <parameter>smb</parameter> backend on CUPS, use this command:
</para>

<para><screen>
&rootprompt;<userinput>lpadmin -p winprinter -v smb://WINDOWSNETBIOSNAME/printersharename \
  -P /path/to/PPD</userinput>
</screen></para>

<para>
The PPD must be able to direct CUPS to generate
the print data for the target model. For PostScript printers, just use
the PPD that would be used with the Windows NT PostScript driver. But
what can you do if the printer is only accessible with a password? Or
if the printer's host is part of another workgroup? This is provided
for: You can include the required parameters as part of the
<filename>smb://</filename> device-URI like this:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><filename>smb://WORKGROUP/WINDOWSNETBIOSNAME/printersharename</filename></listitem>
	<listitem><filename>smb://username:password@WORKGROUP/WINDOWSNETBIOSNAME/printersharename</filename></listitem>
	<listitem><filename>smb://username:password@WINDOWSNETBIOSNAME/printersharename</filename></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Note that the device-URI will be visible in the process list of the
Samba server (e.g., when someone uses the <command>ps -aux</command>
command on Linux), even if the username and passwords are sanitized
before they get written into the log files. So this is an inherently
insecure option, however, it is the only one. Don't use it if you want
to protect your passwords. Better share the printer in a way that
does not require a password! Printing will only work if you have a
working netbios name resolution up and running. Note that this is a
feature of CUPS and you do not necessarily need to have smbd running.

	<title>New Account Reconnection from Windows 200x/XP Troubles</title>

<para>Once you are connected as the wrong user (for
example, as <constant>nobody</constant>, which often occurs if you have 
<smbconfoption><name>map to guest</name><value>bad user</value></smbconfoption>), Windows Explorer will not accept an
attempt to connect again as a different user. There will not be any byte
transfered on the wire to Samba, but still you'll see a stupid error
message that makes you think Samba has denied access. Use
<command>smbstatus</command> to check for active connections. Kill the
PIDs. You still can't re-connect and you get the dreaded
<computeroutput>You can't connect with a second account from the same
machine</computeroutput> message, as soon as you are trying. And you
do not see any single byte arriving at Samba (see logs; use <quote>ethereal</quote>)
indicating a renewed connection attempt. Shut all Explorer Windows.
This makes Windows forget what it has cached in its memory as
established connections. Then reconnect as the right user. The best
method is to use a DOS terminal window and <emphasis>first</emphasis>
do <userinput>net use z: \\&example.server.samba;\print$ /user:root</userinput>. Check
with <command>smbstatus</command> that you are connected under a
different account. Now open the <guilabel>Printers</guilabel> folder (on the Samba server
in the <guilabel>Network Neighborhood</guilabel>), right-click on the
printer in question and select
<guibutton>Connect...</guibutton></para></sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Avoid Being Connected to the Samba Server as the Wrong User</title>
	
<para>You see per <command>smbstatus</command> that you are
connected as user nobody; while you want to be root or
printer admin. This is probably due to 
<smbconfoption><name>map to guest</name><value>bad user</value></smbconfoption>, which silently connects you under the guest account
when you gave (maybe by accident) an incorrect username. Remove
<smbconfoption><name>map to guest</name></smbconfoption>, if you want to prevent
this.</para></sect2>

<title>Upgrading to CUPS Drivers from Adobe Drivers</title>

<para>
This information came from a mailing list posting regarding problems experienced when
upgrading from Adobe drivers to CUPS drivers on Microsoft Windows NT/200x/XP Clients.
</para>

<para>First delete all old Adobe-using printers. Then
delete all old Adobe drivers. (On Windows 200x/XP, right-click in
the background of <guilabel>Printers</guilabel> folder, select <guimenuitem>Server Properties...</guimenuitem>, select
tab <guilabel>Drivers</guilabel> and delete here).</para></sect2>

<sect2><title>Can't Use <quote>cupsaddsmb</quote> on Samba Server Which Is a PDC</title>
<para>Do you use the <quote>naked</quote> root user name? Try to do it
this way: <userinput>cupsaddsmb -U <replaceable>DOMAINNAME</replaceable>\\root -v
<replaceable>printername</replaceable></userinput>> (note the two backslashes: the first one is
required to <quote>escape</quote> the second one).</para></sect2>

<sect2><title>Deleted Windows 200x Printer Driver Is Still Shown</title>
<para>Deleting a printer on the client will not delete the
driver too (to verify, right-click on the white background of the
<guilabel>Printers</guilabel> folder, select <guimenuitem>Server Properties</guimenuitem> and click on the
<guilabel>Drivers</guilabel> tab). These same old drivers will be re-used when you try to
install a printer with the same name. If you want to update to a new
driver, delete the old ones first. Deletion is only possible if no
other printer uses the same driver.</para></sect2>

<sect2><title>Windows 200x/XP "Local Security Policies"</title>
<para>Local Security Policies may not
allow the installation of unsigned drivers. <quote>Local Security Policies</quote>
may not allow the installation of printer drivers at
all.</para></sect2>

<sect2><title>Administrator Cannot Install Printers for All Local Users</title>
<para>Windows XP handles SMB printers on a <quote>per-user</quote> basis.
This means every user needs to install the printer himself. To have a
printer available for everybody, you might want to use the built-in
IPP client capabilities of Win XP. Add a printer with the print path of
<parameter>http://cupsserver:631/printers/printername</parameter>.
We're still looking into this one. Maybe a logon script could
automatically install printers for all
users.</para></sect2>

<sect2><title>Print Change Notify Functions on NT-clients</title>
<para>For print change, notify functions on NT++ clients.
These need to run the <command>Server</command> service first (renamed to
<command>File &amp; Print Sharing for MS Networks</command> in
XP).</para></sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Win XP-SP1</title>

<para>Win XP-SP1 introduced a Point and Print Restriction Policy (this restriction does not apply to
<quote>Administrator</quote> or <quote>Power User</quote> groups of users). In Group Policy
Object Editor, go to <guimenu>User Configuration -> Administrative Templates ->
 Control Panel -> Printers</guimenu>. The policy is automatically set to
<constant>Enabled</constant> and the <constant>Users can only Point
and Print to machines in their Forest</constant> . You probably need
to change it to <constant>Disabled</constant> or <constant>Users can
only Point and Print to these servers</constant> to make
driver downloads from Samba possible.

<title>Print Options for All Users Can't Be Set on Windows 200x/XP</title>

<para>How are you doing it? I bet the wrong way (it is not
easy to find out, though). There are three different ways to bring
you to a dialog that <emphasis>seems</emphasis> to set everything. All
three dialogs <emphasis>look</emphasis> the same, yet only one of them
does what you intend. You need to be
Administrator or Print Administrator to do this for all users. Here
is how I do in on XP:
</para>

<orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">

<listitem><para>The first wrong way:

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Open the <guilabel>Printers</guilabel>
folder.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Right-click on the printer
(<guilabel>remoteprinter on cupshost</guilabel>) and
select in context menu <guimenuitem>Printing

<listitem><para>Look at this dialog closely and remember what it looks
like.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>The second wrong way:

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Open the <guilabel>Printers</guilabel>
folder.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Right-click on the printer (<guilabel>remoteprinter on
cupshost</guilabel>) and select the context menu
<guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Click on the <guilabel>General</guilabel>
tab.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Click on the button <guibutton>Printing
Preferences...</guibutton></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>A new dialog opens. Keep this dialog open and go back
to the parent dialog.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>The third, and the correct way: 

<orderedlist>

<listitem><para>Open the <guilabel>Printers</guilabel>
folder.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Click on the <guilabel>Advanced</guilabel>
tab. (If everything is <quote>grayed out,</quote> then you are not logged
in as a user with enough privileges).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Click on the <guibutton>Printing

<listitem><para>On any of the two new tabs, click on the
<guibutton>Advanced...</guibutton>

<listitem><para>A new dialog opens. Compare this one to the other
identical looking one from <quote>B.5</quote> or A.3".</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
Do you see any difference? I don't either. However, only the last
one, which you arrived at with steps <quote>C.1.-6.</quote>, will save any settings
permanently and be the defaults for new users. If you want all clients
to get the same defaults, you need to conduct these steps <emphasis>as
Administrator</emphasis> (<smbconfoption><name>printer admin</name></smbconfoption> in
&smb.conf;) <emphasis>before</emphasis> a client
downloads the driver (the clients can later set their own
<emphasis>per-user defaults</emphasis> by following the
procedures <emphasis>A</emphasis> or <emphasis>B</emphasis>
above).</para></sect2>

<sect2><title>Most Common Blunders in Driver Settings on Windows Clients</title>
<para>Don't use <parameter>Optimize for
Speed</parameter>, but use <parameter>Optimize for
Portability</parameter> instead (Adobe PS Driver). Don't use
<parameter>Page Independence: No</parameter>: always
settle with  <parameter>Page Independence:
Yes</parameter> (Microsoft PS Driver and CUPS PS Driver for
Windows NT/200x/XP). If there are problems with fonts, use
<parameter>Download as Softfont into
printer</parameter> (Adobe PS Driver). For
<guilabel>TrueType Download Options</guilabel>
choose <constant>Outline</constant>. Use PostScript
Level 2, if you are having trouble with a non-PS printer and if
there is a choice.</para></sect2>

<sect2><title><command>cupsaddsmb</command> Does Not Work with Newly Installed Printer</title>
<para>Symptom: The last command of
<command>cupsaddsmb</command> does not complete successfully:
<command>cmd = setdriver printername printername</command> result was
NT_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL then possibly the printer was not yet
recognized by Samba. Did it show up in Network

<title>Permissions on <filename>/var/spool/samba/</filename> Get Reset After Each Reboot</title>
<para>Have you ever by accident set the CUPS spool directory to
the same location? (<parameter>RequestRoot /var/spool/samba/</parameter> in <filename>cupsd.conf</filename> or
the other way round: <filename>/var/spool/cups/</filename> is set as
<smbconfoption><name>path</name></smbconfoption>> in the <smbconfsection>[printers]</smbconfsection>

<!--FIXME-->
<parameter>RequestRoot /var/spool/cups/</parameter> in

/var/spool/samba</value></smbconfoption> in the <smbconfsection>[printers]</smbconfsection>
section of &smb.conf;. Otherwise cupsd will

<title>Print Queue Called <quote>lp</quote> Mis-handles Print Jobs</title>

<para>
In this case a print queue called <quote>lp</quote> intermittently swallows jobs and
spits out completely different ones from what was sent.
</para>

<para>It is a bad idea to name any printer <quote>lp</quote>. This
is the traditional UNIX name for the default printer. CUPS may be set
up to do an automatic creation of Implicit Classes. This means, to
group all printers with the same name to a pool of devices, and
load-balancing the jobs across them in a round-robin fashion. Chances
are high that someone else has a printer named <quote>lp</quote> too. You may
receive his jobs and send your own to his device unwittingly. To have
tight control over the printer names, set <parameter>BrowseShortNames
No</parameter>. It will present any printer as <replaceable>printername@cupshost</replaceable>
and then gives you better control over what may happen in a large
networked environment.</para></sect2>

<sect2><title>Location of Adobe PostScript Driver Files for <quote>cupsaddsmb</quote></title>
<para>Use <command>smbclient</command> to connect to any
Windows box with a shared PostScript printer: <command>smbclient
//windowsbox/print\$ -U guest</command>. You can navigate to the
<filename>W32X86/2</filename> subdir to <command>mget ADOBE*</command>
and other files or to <filename>WIN40/0</filename> to do the same.
Another option is to download the <filename>*.exe</filename> packaged
files from the Adobe Web site.</para></sect2>

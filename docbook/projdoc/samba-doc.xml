This book is a collection of HOWTOs added to Samba documentation over the years.
Samba is always under development, and so is its' documentation. This release of the
documentation represents a major revision or layout as well as contents.
The most recent version of this document can be found at
<ulink url="http://www.samba.org/">http://www.samba.org/</ulink>
on the "Documentation" page.  Please send updates to

The Samba-Team would like to express sincere thanks to the many people who have with
or without their knowledge contributed to this update. The size and scope of this
project would not have been possible without significant community contribution. A not
insignificant number of ideas for inclusion (if not content itself) has been obtained
from a number of Unofficial HOWTOs - to each such author a big "Thank-you" is also offered.
Please keep publishing your Unofficial HOWTOs - they are a source of inspiration and
application knowledge that is most to be desired by many Samba users and administrators.

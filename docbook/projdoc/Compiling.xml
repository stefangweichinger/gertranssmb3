<title>Wie man Samba kompiliert</title>

<para>
You can obtain the Samba source from the
<ulink url="http://samba.org/">Samba Website.</ulink> To obtain a development version, 
you can download Samba from CVS or using <command>rsync</command>.
</para>

<title>Access Samba Source Code via CVS</title>


<sect2>
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>CVS</primary></indexterm>
Samba is developed in an open environment. Developers use
Concurrent Versioning System (CVS) to <quote>checkin</quote> (also known as 
<quote>commit</quote>) new source code. Samba's various CVS branches can
be accessed via anonymous CVS using the instructions
detailed in this chapter.
</para>

<para>
This chapter is a modified version of the instructions found at
<ulink noescape="1" url="http://samba.org/samba/cvs.html">http://samba.org/samba/cvs.html</ulink>
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>CVS Access to samba.org</title>

<para>
The machine samba.org runs a publicly accessible CVS 
repository for access to the source code of several packages, 
including Samba, rsync, distcc, ccache, and jitterbug. There are two main ways
of accessing the CVS server on this host:
</para>

<sect3>
<title>Access via CVSweb</title>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>CVS</primary><secondary>web</secondary></indexterm>
You can access the source code via your favorite WWW browser. This allows you to access
the contents of individual files in the repository and also to look at the revision 
history and commit logs of individual files. You can also ask for a diff 
listing between any two versions on the repository.
</para>

<para>
Use the URL:
<ulink noescape="1" url="http://samba.org/cgi-bin/CVSweb">http://samba.org/cgi-bin/CVSweb</ulink>
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Access via CVS</title>

<para>
You can also access the source code via a 
normal CVS client. This gives you much more control over what you can 
do with the repository and allows you to checkout whole source trees 
and keep them up-to-date via normal CVS commands. This is the 
preferred method of access if you are a developer and not
just a casual browser.
</para>

<para>
To download the latest CVS source code, point your
browser at the URL :
<ulink noescape="1" url="http://www.cyclic.com/">http://www.cyclic.com/</ulink>.
and click on the <quote>How to get CVS</quote> link. CVS is free software under 
the GNU GPL (as is Samba). Note that there are several graphical CVS clients
that provide a graphical interface to the sometimes mundane CVS commands.
Links to theses clients are also available from the Cyclic Web site.
</para>

<para>
To gain access via anonymous CVS, use the following steps. 
For this example it is assumed that you want a copy of the 
Samba source code. For the other source code repositories 
on this system just substitute the correct package name.
</para>

<procedure>
	<title>Retrieving Samba using CVS</title>

	<step>
	<para>
	Install a recent copy of CVS. All you really need is a 
	copy of the CVS client binary. 
	</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	<para>
	Run the command:
	</para>

	<para>
	<userinput>cvs -d :pserver:cvs@samba.org:/cvsroot login</userinput>
	</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	
	<para>
	When it asks you for a password, type <userinput>cvs</userinput>.
	</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	<para>
	Run the command 
	</para>
	
	<para>
	<userinput>cvs -d :pserver:CVS@samba.org:/cvsroot co samba</userinput>.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	This will create a directory called <filename>samba</filename> containing the 
	latest Samba source code (i.e., the HEAD tagged CVS branch). This 
	currently corresponds to the 3.0 development tree. 
	</para>
	
	<para>
	CVS branches other then HEAD can be obtained by using the
	<option>-r</option> and defining a tag name. A list of branch tag names 
	can be found on the <quote>Development</quote> page of the Samba Web site. A common
	request is to obtain the latest 3.0 release code. This could be done by 
	using the following command:
	</para>
	
	<para>
	<userinput>cvs -d :pserver:cvs@samba.org:/cvsroot co -r SAMBA_3_0 samba</userinput>.
	</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	<para>
	Whenever you want to merge in the latest code changes, use 
	the following command from within the Samba directory: 
	</para>
	
	<para>
	<userinput>cvs update -d -P</userinput>
	</para>
	</step>
</procedure>

<sect1>
	<title>Accessing the Samba Sources via rsync and ftp</title>


	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>rsync</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>ftp</primary></indexterm>
	<parameter>pserver.samba.org</parameter> also exports unpacked copies of most parts of the CVS
	tree at <ulink noescape="1" url="ftp://pserver.samba.org/pub/unpacked">ftp://pserver.samba.org/pub/unpacked</ulink> and also via anonymous rsync at 
	<ulink noescape="1" url="rsync://pserver.samba.org/ftp/unpacked/">rsync://pserver.samba.org/ftp/unpacked/</ulink>. I recommend using rsync rather than ftp.
	See <ulink noescape="1" url="http://rsync.samba.org/">the rsync homepage</ulink> for more info on rsync.                      
	</para>

	<para>
	The disadvantage of the unpacked trees is that they do not support automatic
	merging of local changes like CVS does. <command>rsync</command> access is most convenient 
	for an initial install.                      
	</para>

<title>Verifying Samba's PGP Signature</title>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>GPG</primary></indexterm>
It is strongly recommended that you verify the PGP signature for any source file before
installing it. Even if you're not downloading from a mirror site, verifying PGP signatures
should be a standard reflex. Many people today use the GNU GPG toolset in place of PGP.
GPG can substitute for PGP.
</para>


<para>
With that said, go ahead and download the following files:
</para>

<para><screen>
&prompt;<userinput>wget http://us1.samba.org/samba/ftp/samba-2.2.8a.tar.asc</userinput>
&prompt;<userinput>wget http://us1.samba.org/samba/ftp/samba-pubkey.asc</userinput>
</screen></para>


<para>
<indexterm><primary>PGP</primary></indexterm>
The first file is the PGP signature for the Samba source file; the other is the Samba public
PGP key itself. Import the public PGP key with:
</para>

<screen>
&prompt;<userinput>gpg --import samba-pubkey.asc</userinput>
</screen>

<para>
and verify the Samba source code integrity with:
</para>

<screen>
&prompt;<userinput>gzip -d samba-2.2.8a.tar.gz</userinput>
&prompt;<userinput>gpg --verify samba-2.2.8a.tar.asc</userinput>
</screen>

<para>
If you receive a message like, <quote>Good signature from Samba Distribution Verification Key...</quote>
then all is well. The warnings about trust relationships can be ignored. An
example of what you would not want to see would be:
</para>

<para><screen>
     gpg: BAD signature from <quote>Samba Distribution Verification Key</quote>
</screen></para>

</sect1>

<sect1>
	<title>Building the Binaries</title>
	

	<para>
<indexterm><primary>configure</primary></indexterm>
		To build the binaries, first run the program <userinput>./configure
	</userinput> in the source directory. This should automatically 
	configure Samba for your operating system. If you have unusual 
	needs, then you may wish to run</para>
	
<para><screen>&rootprompt;<userinput>./configure --help
</userinput></screen></para>
	
<para>first to see what special options you can enable. Now execute <userinput>./configure</userinput> with any arguments it might need:</para>

<para><screen>&rootprompt;<userinput>./configure <replaceable>[... arguments ...]</replaceable></userinput></screen></para>
	
	<para>Executing</para>

	
	<para>
<indexterm><primary>make</primary></indexterm>
		<screen>&rootprompt;<userinput>make</userinput></screen></para>
	
	<para>will create the binaries. Once it is successfully 
	compiled you can use</para>
	
<para><screen>&rootprompt;<userinput>make install</userinput></screen></para>
	
	<para>to install the binaries and manual pages. You can 
	separately install the binaries and/or man pages using</para>
	
<para><screen>&rootprompt;<userinput>make installbin
</userinput></screen></para>
	
	<para>and</para>
	
	<para><screen>&rootprompt;<userinput>make installman
	</userinput></screen></para>

	<para>Note that if you are upgrading from a previous version 
	of Samba you might like to know that the old versions of 
	the binaries will be renamed with an <quote>.old</quote> extension. You 
	can go back to the previous version with</para>
	
<para><screen>&rootprompt;<userinput>make revert
</userinput></screen></para>
	
	<para>if you find this version a disaster!</para>

	<sect2>
	<title>Compiling Samba with Active Directory Support</title>
	
	<para>In order to compile Samba with ADS support, you need to have installed
	on your system:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	
	    <listitem><para>The MIT or Heimdal kerberos development libraries
	    (either install from the sources or use a package).</para></listitem>
	
	    <listitem><para>The OpenLDAP development libraries.</para></listitem>
	    
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>If your kerberos libraries are in a non-standard location, then
		remember to add the configure option 
		<option>--with-krb5=<replaceable>DIR</replaceable></option>.</para>

	<para>After you run configure, make sure that 
		<filename>include/config.h</filename> it generates contain lines like 
		this:</para>

<para><programlisting>
#define HAVE_KRB5 1
#define HAVE_LDAP 1
</programlisting></para>

	<para>If it does not, configure did not find your KRB5 libraries or
	your LDAP libraries. Look in <filename>config.log</filename> to figure
	out why and fix it.</para>

	<sect3>
	<title>Installing the Required Packages for Debian</title>

	<para>On Debian, you need to install the following packages:</para>
	<para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>libkrb5-dev</listitem>
			<listitem>krb5-user</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Installing the Required Packages for Red Hat Linux</title>

	<para>On Red Hat Linux, this means you should have at least: </para>
	<para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>krb5-workstation (for kinit)</listitem>
			<listitem>krb5-libs (for linking with)</listitem>
			<listitem>krb5-devel (because you are compiling from source)</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<para>in addition to the standard development environment.</para>

	<para>If these files are not installed on your system, you should check the installation
	CDs to find which has them and install the files using your tool of choice. If in doubt
	about what tool to use, refer to the Red Hat Linux documentation.</para>

	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>SuSE Linux Package Requirements</title>

	<para>SuSE Linux installs Heimdal packages that may be required to allow you to build
	binary packages. You should verify that the development libraries have been installed on
	your system.
	</para>

	<para>SuSE Linux Samba RPMs support Kerberos. Please refer to the documentation for
	your SuSE Linux system for information regading SuSE Linux specific configuration.
	Additionally, SuSE are very active in the maintenance of Samba packages that provide
	the maximum capabilities that are available. You should consider using SuSE provided
	packages where they are available.

	<title>Starting the &smbd; and &nmbd;</title>


	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>inetd</primary></indexterm>
		You must choose to start &smbd; and &nmbd; either
	as daemons or from <application>inetd</application>. Don't try
	to do both!  Either you can put them in <filename>
	inetd.conf</filename> and have them started on demand
	by <application>inetd</application> or <application>xinetd</application>, 
	or you can start them as
	daemons either from the command line or in <filename>
	/etc/rc.local</filename>. See the man pages for details
	on the command line options. Take particular care to read
	the bit about what user you need to have to start
	Samba. In many cases, you must be root.</para>

	<para>The main advantage of starting &smbd;
	and &nmbd; using the recommended daemon method
	is that they will respond slightly more quickly to an initial connection
	request.</para>

	<sect2>
		<title>Starting from inetd.conf</title>

		<indexterm><primary>inetd</primary></indexterm>
		
		<note>
		<para>The following will be different if 
		you use NIS, NIS+ or LDAP to distribute services maps.</para>
		</note>
		
		<para>Look at your <filename>/etc/services</filename>. 
		What is defined at port 139/tcp? If nothing is defined, 
		then add a line like this:</para>

		<para><programlisting>netbios-ssn     139/tcp</programlisting></para>

		<para>Similarly for 137/udp, you should have an entry like:</para>

		<para><programlisting>netbios-ns	137/udp</programlisting></para>

		<para>Next, edit your <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename> 
		and add two lines like this:</para>

		<para><programlisting>
		netbios-ssn stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/samba/bin/smbd smbd 
		netbios-ns dgram udp wait root /usr/local/samba/bin/nmbd nmbd 
		</programlisting></para>

		<para>The exact syntax of <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename> 
		varies between UNIXes. Look at the other entries in inetd.conf 
		for a guide. </para>

	<para>
		<indexterm><primary>xinetd</primary></indexterm>
		Some distributions use xinetd instead of inetd. Consult the 
		xinetd manual for configuration information.</para>

		<note><para>Some UNIXes already have entries like netbios_ns 
		(note the underscore) in <filename>/etc/services</filename>. 
		You must edit <filename>/etc/services</filename> or
		<filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename> to make them consistent.
		</para></note>

		<note><para>
		<indexterm><primary>ifconfig</primary></indexterm>
				On many systems you may need to use the 
		<smbconfoption><name>interfaces</name></smbconfoption> option in &smb.conf; to specify the IP
		address and netmask of your interfaces. Run 
		<application>ifconfig</application> 
		as root if you do not know what the broadcast is for your
		net. &nmbd; tries to determine it at run 
		time, but fails on some UNIXes. 
		</para></note>

		<warning><para>Many UNIXes only accept around five 
		parameters on the command line in <filename>inetd.conf</filename>. 
		This means you shouldn't use spaces between the options and 
		arguments, or you should use a script and start the script 
		from <command>inetd</command>.</para></warning>

		<para>Restart <application>inetd</application>, perhaps just send 
			it a HUP. </para>

		<screen>
			&rootprompt;<userinput>killall -HUP inetd</userinput>
		</screen>
		
	</sect2>
	
	<sect2>
		<title>Alternative: Starting &smbd; as a Daemon</title>

		
		<para>
		<indexterm><primary>daemon</primary></indexterm>
			To start the server as a daemon, you should create 
		a script something like this one, perhaps calling 
		it <filename>startsmb</filename>.</para>

		<para><programlisting>
		#!/bin/sh
		/usr/local/samba/bin/smbd -D 
		/usr/local/samba/bin/nmbd -D 
		</programlisting></para>

		<para>Make it executable with <command>chmod 
		+x startsmb</command></para>

		<para>You can then run <command>startsmb</command> by 
		hand or execute it from <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename>.
		</para>

		<para>To kill it, send a kill signal to the processes 
			&nmbd; and &smbd;.</para>

		<note><para>If you use the SVR4 style init system, 
		you may like to look at the <filename>examples/svr4-startup</filename>
		script to make Samba fit into that system.</para></note>

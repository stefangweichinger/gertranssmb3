	<para>Oplocks are the way that SMB clients get permission 
	from a server to locally cache file operations. If a server grants 
	an oplock (opportunistic lock) then the client is free to assume 
	that it is the only one accessing the file and it will aggressively 
	cache file data. With some oplock types the client may even cache 
	file open/close operations. This can give enormous performance benefits.

	<para>When you set <command moreinfo="none">fake oplocks = yes</command>, <citerefentry>
	<refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> will
	always grant oplock requests no matter how many clients are using the file.</para>

	<para>It is generally much better to use the real <link linkend="OPLOCKS">
	<parameter moreinfo="none">oplocks</parameter></link> support rather 
	than this parameter.</para>
		
	<para>If you enable this option on all read-only shares or 
	shares that you know will only be accessed from one client at a 
	time such as physically read-only media like CDROMs, you will see 
	a big performance improvement on many operations. If you enable 
	this option on shares where multiple clients may be accessing the 
	files read-write at the same time you can get data corruption. Use 
	this option carefully!</para>

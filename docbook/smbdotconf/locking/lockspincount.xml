	<para>This parameter controls the number of times
	that smbd should attempt to gain a byte range lock on the 
	behalf of a client request.  Experiments have shown that
	Windows 2k servers do not reply with a failure if the lock
	could not be immediately granted, but try a few more times
	in case the lock could later be aquired.  This behavior
	is used to support PC database formats such as MS Access
	and FoxPro.

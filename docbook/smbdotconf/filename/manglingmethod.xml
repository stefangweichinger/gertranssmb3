<listitem>
	<para> controls the algorithm used for the generating
	the mangled names. Can take two different values, &quot;hash&quot; and
	&quot;hash2&quot;. &quot;hash&quot; is  the default and is the algorithm that has been
	used in Samba for many years. &quot;hash2&quot; is a newer and considered
	a better algorithm (generates less collisions) in the names.
	However, many Win32 applications store the mangled names and so
	changing to the new algorithm must not be done
	lightly as these applications may break unless reinstalled.</para>

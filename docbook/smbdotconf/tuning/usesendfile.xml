    <para>If this parameter is <constant>yes</constant>, and Samba
    was built with the --with-sendfile-support option, and the underlying operating
    system supports sendfile system call, then some SMB read calls (mainly ReadAndX
    and ReadRaw) will use the more efficient sendfile system call for files that
    are exclusively oplocked. This may make more efficient use of the system CPU's
    and cause Samba to be faster. This is off by default as it's effects are unknown
    as yet.</para>

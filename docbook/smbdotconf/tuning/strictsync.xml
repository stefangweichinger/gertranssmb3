    <para>Many Windows applications (including the Windows 98 explorer
    shell) seem to confuse flushing buffer contents to disk with doing
    a sync to disk. Under UNIX, a sync call forces the process to be
    suspended until the kernel has ensured that all outstanding data in
    kernel disk buffers has been safely stored onto stable storage.
    This is very slow and should only be done rarely. Setting this
    parameter to <constant>no</constant> (the default) means that
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>
    <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> ignores the Windows
    applications requests for a sync call. There is only a possibility
    of losing data if the operating system itself that Samba is running
    on crashes, so there is little danger in this default setting. In
    addition, this fixes many performance problems that people have
    reported with the new Windows98 explorer shell file copies.</para>

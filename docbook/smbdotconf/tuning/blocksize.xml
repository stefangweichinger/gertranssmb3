    <para>This parameter controls the behavior of <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>
    <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> when reporting disk free 
    sizes. By default, this reports a disk block size of 1024 bytes.

    <para>Changing this parameter may have some effect on the
    efficiency of client writes, this is not yet confirmed. This
    parameter was added to allow advanced administrators to change
    it (usually to a higher value) and test the effect it has on
    client write performance without re-compiling the code. As this
    is an experimental option it may be removed in a future release.
    </para>

    <para>Changing this option does not change the disk free reporting
    size, just the block size unit reported to the client.

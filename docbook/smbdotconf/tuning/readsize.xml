    <para>The option <parameter moreinfo="none">read size</parameter> 
    affects the overlap of disk reads/writes with network reads/writes. 
    If the amount of data being transferred in several of the SMB 
    commands (currently SMBwrite, SMBwriteX and SMBreadbraw) is larger 
    than this value then the server begins writing the data before it 
    has received the whole packet from the network, or in the case of 
    SMBreadbraw, it begins writing to the network before all the data 
    has been read from disk.</para>

    <para>This overlapping works best when the speeds of disk and 
    network access are similar, having very little effect when the 
    speed of one is much greater than the other.</para>

    <para>The default value is 16384, but very little experimentation 
    has been done yet to determine the optimal value, and it is likely 
    that the best value will vary greatly between systems anyway. 
    A value over 65536 is pointless and will cause you to allocate 
    memory unnecessarily.</para>

    <para>Default: <command moreinfo="none">read size = 16384</command></para>

    <para>Example: <command moreinfo="none">read size = 8192</command></para>

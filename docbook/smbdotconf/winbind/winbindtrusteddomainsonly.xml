<listitem>
	<para>This parameter is designed to allow Samba servers that
	are members of a Samba controlled domain to use UNIX accounts
	distributed vi NIS, rsync, or LDAP as the uid's for winbindd users
	in the hosts primary domain.  Therefore, the user 'SAMBA\user1' would
	be mapped to the account 'user1' in /etc/passwd instead of allocating
	a new uid for him or her.

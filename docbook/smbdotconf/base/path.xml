        <para>This parameter specifies a directory to which 
	the user of the service is to be given access. In the case of 
	printable services, this is where print data will spool prior to 
	being submitted to the host for printing.</para>

	<para>For a printable service offering guest access, the service 
	should be readonly and the path should be world-writeable and 
	have the sticky bit set. This is not mandatory of course, but 
	you probably won't get the results you expect if you do 
	otherwise.</para>

	<para>Any occurrences of <parameter moreinfo="none">%u</parameter> in the path 
	will be replaced with the UNIX username that the client is using 
	on this connection. Any occurrences of <parameter moreinfo="none">%m</parameter> 
	will be replaced by the NetBIOS name of the machine they are 
	connecting from. These replacements are very useful for setting 
	up pseudo home directories for users.</para>

	<para>Note that this path will be based on <link linkend="ROOTDIR">
	<parameter moreinfo="none">root dir</parameter></link> if one was specified.</para>

	<para>Default: <emphasis>none</emphasis></para>

	<para>Example: <command moreinfo="none">path = /home/fred</command></para>

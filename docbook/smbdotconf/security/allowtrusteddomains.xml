    <para>This option only takes effect when the <link linkend="SECURITY">
    <parameter moreinfo="none">security</parameter></link> option is set to 
    <constant>server</constant> or <constant>domain</constant>.  
    If it is set to no, then attempts to connect to a resource from 
    a domain or workgroup other than the one which smbd is running 
    in will fail, even if that domain is trusted by the remote server 
    doing the authentication.</para>
		
    <para>This is useful if you only want your Samba server to 
    serve resources to users in the domain it is a member of. As 
    an example, suppose that there are two domains DOMA and DOMB.  DOMB 
    is trusted by DOMA, which contains the Samba server.  Under normal 
    circumstances, a user with an account in DOMB can then access the 
    resources of a UNIX account with the same account name on the 
    Samba server even if they do not have an account in DOMA.  This 
    can make implementing a security boundary difficult.</para>

    <para>Default: <command moreinfo="none">allow trusted domains = yes</command></para>

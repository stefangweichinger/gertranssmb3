    <para>This is a username which will be used for access 
    to services which are specified as <link linkend="GUESTOK"><parameter moreinfo="none">
    guest ok</parameter></link> (see below). Whatever privileges this 
    user has will be available to any client connecting to the guest service. 
    Typically this user will exist in the password file, but will not
    have a valid login. The user account &quot;ftp&quot; is often a good choice 
    for this parameter. If a username is specified in a given service, 
    the specified username overrides this one.
    </para>

    <para>One some systems the default guest account &quot;nobody&quot; may not 
    be able to print. Use another account in this case. You should test 
    this by trying to log in as your guest user (perhaps by using the 
    <command moreinfo="none">su -</command> command) and trying to print using the 
    system print command such as <command moreinfo="none">lpr(1)</command> or <command moreinfo="none">
    lp(1)</command>.</para>

    <para>This parameter does not accept % macros, because
    many parts of the system require this value to be
    constant for correct operation.</para>
		
    <para>Default: <emphasis>specified at compile time, usually &quot;nobody&quot;</emphasis></para>

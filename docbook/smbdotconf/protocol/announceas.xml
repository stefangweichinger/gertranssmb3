<listitem>
    <para>This specifies what type of server <citerefentry><refentrytitle>nmbd</refentrytitle>
    <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> will announce itself as, to a network neighborhood browse 
    list. By default this is set to Windows NT. The valid options 
    are : &quot;NT Server&quot; (which can also be written as &quot;NT&quot;), 
    &quot;NT Workstation&quot;, &quot;Win95&quot; or &quot;WfW&quot; meaning Windows NT Server, 
    Windows NT Workstation, Windows 95 and Windows for Workgroups 
    respectively. Do not change this parameter unless you have a 
    specific need to stop Samba appearing as an NT server as this 
    may prevent Samba servers from participating as browser servers 
    correctly.</para>

    <para>Default: <command moreinfo="none">announce as = NT Server</command></para>

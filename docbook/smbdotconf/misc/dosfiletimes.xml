<listitem>
	<para>Under DOS and Windows, if a user can write to a 
	file they can change the timestamp on it. Under POSIX semantics, 
	only the owner of the file or root may change the timestamp. By 
	default, Samba runs with POSIX semantics and refuses to change the 
	timestamp on a file if the user <command moreinfo="none">smbd</command> is acting 
	on behalf of is not the file owner. Setting this option to <constant>
	yes</constant> allows DOS semantics and <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> will change the file 
	timestamp as DOS requires.</para>

	<para>Default: <command moreinfo="none">dos filetimes = no</command></para>

	<para> The default behavior in Samba is to provide 
	UNIX-like behavior where only the owner of a file/directory is 
	able to change the permissions on it.  However, this behavior
	is often confusing to  DOS/Windows users.  Enabling this parameter 
	allows a user who has write access to the file (by whatever 
	means) to modify the permissions on it.  Note that a user
	belonging to the group owning the file will not be allowed to
	change permissions if the group is only granted read access.
	Ownership of the file/directory is not changed, only the permissions 
	are modified.</para>

	<para>The <parameter moreinfo="none">dfree command</parameter> setting
	should only be used on systems where a problem occurs with the
	internal disk space calculations. This has been known to happen
	with Ultrix, but may occur with other operating systems. The
	symptom that was seen was an error of &quot;Abort Retry
	Ignore&quot; at the end of each directory listing.</para>
		
	<para>This setting allows the replacement of the internal routines to
	calculate the total disk space and amount available with an external
	routine. The example below gives a possible script that might fulfill
	this function.</para>

	<para>The external program will be passed a single parameter indicating 
	a directory in the filesystem being queried. This will typically consist
	of the string <filename moreinfo="none">./</filename>. The script should return two 
	integers in ASCII. The first should be the total disk space in blocks, 
	and the second should be the number of available blocks. An optional 
	third return value can give the block size in bytes. The default 
	blocksize is 1024 bytes.</para>

	<para>Note: Your script should <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> be setuid or 
	setgid and should be owned by (and writeable only by) root!</para>

	<para>Default: <emphasis>By default internal routines for 
	determining the disk capacity and remaining space will be used.
	</emphasis></para>

	<para>Example: <command moreinfo="none">dfree command = /usr/local/samba/bin/dfree</command></para>

	<para>Where the script dfree (which must be made executable) could be:</para>

<para><programlisting format="linespecific"> 
#!/bin/sh
df $1 | tail -1 | awk '{print $2&quot; &quot;$4}'
</programlisting></para>

	<para>or perhaps (on Sys V based systems):</para>

<para><programlisting format="linespecific"> 
#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/df -k $1 | tail -1 | awk '{print $3&quot; &quot;$5}'
</programlisting></para>
		
	<para>Note that you may have to replace the command names with full path names on some systems.</para>

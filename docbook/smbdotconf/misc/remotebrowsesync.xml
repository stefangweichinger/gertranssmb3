	<para>This option allows you to setup <citerefentry><refentrytitle>nmbd</refentrytitle>
        <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> to periodically request 
	synchronization of browse lists with the master browser of a Samba 
	server that is on a remote segment. This option will allow you to 
	gain browse lists for multiple workgroups across routed networks. This 
	is done in a manner that does not work with any non-Samba servers.</para>

	<para>This is useful if you want your Samba server and all local 
	clients to appear in a remote workgroup for which the normal browse 
	propagation rules don't work. The remote workgroup can be anywhere 
	that you can send IP packets to.</para>

	<para>For example:</para>
		
	<para><command moreinfo="none">remote browse sync = 192.168.2.255 192.168.4.255</command></para>

	<para>the above line would cause <command moreinfo="none">nmbd</command> to request 
	the master browser on the specified subnets or addresses to 
	synchronize their browse lists with the local server.</para>

	<para>The IP addresses you choose would normally be the broadcast 
	addresses of the remote networks, but can also be the IP addresses 
	of known browse masters if your network config is that stable. If 
	a machine IP address is given Samba makes NO attempt to validate 
	that the remote machine is available, is listening, nor that it 
	is in fact the browse master on its segment.</para>

	<para>Default: <command moreinfo="none">remote browse sync = &lt;empty string&gt;</command></para>

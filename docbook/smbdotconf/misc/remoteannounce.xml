	<para>This option allows you to setup <citerefentry><refentrytitle>nmbd</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>to periodically announce itself 
	to arbitrary IP addresses with an arbitrary workgroup name.</para>

	<para>This is useful if you want your Samba server to appear 
	in a remote workgroup for which the normal browse propagation 
	rules don't work. The remote workgroup can be anywhere that you 
	can send IP packets to.</para>

	<para>For example:</para>

	<para><command moreinfo="none">remote announce = 192.168.2.255/SERVERS 
	192.168.4.255/STAFF</command></para>

	<para>the above line would cause <command moreinfo="none">nmbd</command> to announce itself 
	to the two given IP addresses using the given workgroup names. 
	If you leave out the workgroup name then the one given in 
	the <link linkend="WORKGROUP"><parameter moreinfo="none">workgroup</parameter></link> 
	parameter is used instead.</para>

	<para>The IP addresses you choose would normally be the broadcast 
	addresses of the remote networks, but can also be the IP addresses 
	of known browse masters if your network config is that stable.</para>

	<para>See <link linkend="NetworkBrowsing"/>.</para>
		
	<para>Default: <command moreinfo="none">remote announce = &lt;empty string&gt;</command></para>

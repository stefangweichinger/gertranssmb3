	<para>This parameter controls whether or not links 
	in the UNIX file system may be followed by the server. Links 
	that point to areas within the directory tree exported by the 
	server are always allowed; this parameter controls access only 
	to areas that are outside the directory tree being exported.</para>

	<para>Note that setting this parameter can have a negative 
	effect on your server performance due to the extra system calls 
	that Samba has to  do in order to perform the link checks.</para>

	<para>Default: <command moreinfo="none">wide links = yes</command></para>

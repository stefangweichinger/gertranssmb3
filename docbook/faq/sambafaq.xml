This is the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document for
Samba, the free and very popular SMB server product. An SMB server
allows file and printer connections from clients such as Windows,
OS/2, Linux and others. Current to version 3.0. Please send any
corrections to the samba documentation mailinglist at
<ulink url="mailto:samba-doc@samba.org">samba-doc@samba.org</ulink>. 
This FAQ was based on the old Samba FAQ by Dan Shearer and Paul Blackman, 
and the old samba text documents which were mostly written by John Terpstra.
